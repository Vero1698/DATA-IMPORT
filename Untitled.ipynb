This is the artillery—slow\\r\\nmarching—which is moving its cannon under a fantastic camouflage, a\\r\\nmockery of reality. A glistening slope of soaked earth is set in a frame\\r\\nof shattered trees, twisted into indescribable convulsions of anguish\\r\\nwith the gaping wounds inflicted by the storm of iron. On their horses,\\r\\nalready covered with winter shag, the poilus, slouched in all sorts of\\r\\npositions, having no suggestion of the rigid form of the manœuvre, are\\r\\ngoing from one battlefield to another without any other thought except\\r\\nthat of just keeping on going.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn colorless and shapeless uniforms, indescribably rigged out, and\\r\\nin poses of the most pleasurable leisure, the soldiers of France\\r\\npicturesquely slip from glory to glory, less aware, it seems, of\\r\\nhistoric grandeur than of serene gladness in implacable duty. They are\\r\\npicturesque because nature will have it so, but without any romanticism\\r\\nor sense of posing—officers hardly to be distinguished from privates by\\r\\nvague, soiled stripes—all the men enveloped in a halo of splendor above\\r\\nanything known to ordinary humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pugnacious pipe or the sportive cigarette hinders their expression of\\r\\nany personal reflection. Only their eyes are animate, and these express\\r\\nthings which cannot be told in words lest they be profaned. The line of\\r\\ntheir lip is youthful under a silky moustache or firm with age under gray\\r\\nbrush. But the fire of their look, framed in their dark helmets, leaps\\r\\nout with quiet intensity to meet the tragic unknown that no longer can\\r\\nbring surprise. They are our soldiers of the year II who are following\\r\\nthe Biblical column of fire. They see something. They go to it. Ashamed\\r\\nof my humility, I should like to find words to say to them. But, were I\\r\\na poet, they would have no need of hearkening to me, since the greatest\\r\\nbeauty of man lies in them, and since, unwitting of utterance, which at\\r\\nbest seems inept, these men live on the summits of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the “old classes” who prosaically break stone at the side of the road\\r\\nor work with the shovel, the pickaxe, the broom, making the toilette\\r\\nof the road of triumph, what an injustice if I did not mention them!\\r\\nHow does it happen that the noblest soldier is always the one I chance\\r\\nupon? That is the miracle of these men; and when I tell you that on the\\r\\nbattlefield of the Aisne the “old classes,” not granting that it was\\r\\nnecessary to wait to the end of the battle before beginning to clear and\\r\\nrebuild, went off into the hottest of the action to fill up craters, to\\r\\nbreak stones, to place tree-trunks and beams during heavy fire, without\\r\\nvouchsafing the Boche a single hasty gesture, so that they might the\\r\\nmore quickly open the way for revictualling and for the bringing up of\\r\\nartillery—when I tell you this, you will admit that they do not deserve a\\r\\nlesser greeting than their “young ones.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the infantryman—could I commit the supreme injustice of forgetting\\r\\nhim? That is impossible when one has gone over the battleground where\\r\\nhe has taken possession of the burrows of the Boches, among heaps of\\r\\nmunition material, cases of supplies, an indescribable débris, abandoned\\r\\nwith their dead and wounded in the haste of a desperate fight. What we\\r\\ncannot understand is that our little poilu can pass so quickly from the\\r\\napathy of the trench to the extreme fury of the attack, and then from the\\r\\nviolence of the offensive to the calm smile of a victory of which his\\r\\nmodesty seems to say: “It was as easy as all that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not hear a single boast, or see a disagreeable act, or hear a word\\r\\nthat sounded false. Like a good-hearted proprietor returning home, they\\r\\ntook possession of the shelters of the Boche so hurriedly abandoned.\\r\\nHere can be found the comforts of war, if these two words can be spoken\\r\\ntogether. The men talk in groups at the openings of the underground\\r\\npassages, camouflaged by the enemy himself. The indifference of their\\r\\nattitudes, the ease of their familiar conversation, in which there mingle\\r\\nno bragging (though this is the place for it), are more characteristic\\r\\nof the situation of some simple bourgeois who have happened to meet on\\r\\nSunday in the street. A major begs my pardon for wearing a collared\\r\\nshirt, which is not perfectly “regular” at an official review.\\r\\nMessengers pass, throwing out a word or making a simple sign. Officers\\r\\nstep up for brief explanations. A half-salute, a nodding of the head—it\\r\\nis over. Not far away, on the road cut into the rock, where the stupid\\r\\nBoche, after our passings, sends his impotent shells, our always young\\r\\n“old classes” hang on to the slopes in order to see the projectile fall,\\r\\nand make uncomplimentary remarks about the gunner. Then work is resumed\\r\\ntill the next warning whistles in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is after twelve and we have not yet dined. A big devil of a Moroccan\\r\\ncolonel, with a Don Quixotic face under an extraordinary headpiece,\\r\\ninvites us to his P. C. (post of command), where the Boche has left\\r\\nuseful bits of installation. A black hole is two steps away from us. We\\r\\ngo down into the ground, over abrupt descents, and there we are protected\\r\\nfrom the “marmites” in a dark corridor lit by candles stuck into the\\r\\nmouths of German gas masks. We sit down on anything handy (I even have\\r\\nthe favor of a chair), before a board which also serves as the colonel’s\\r\\nbed, while arms whose body remains invisible serve us with dishes not to\\r\\nbe disdained by a gourmand. How did they get there? I cannot undertake to\\r\\nexplain that. The walk in the open air, the tragic nature of the place,\\r\\nthe joy in land reconquered, no doubt all lend particular spice to the\\r\\ncomradeship of these men who forget that they have done great deeds as\\r\\nsoon as they have done them. Pictures and illustrated pages tremble in\\r\\nthe fluttering candle-lights, among them a Victorious France, drawn\\r\\nby the pencil of the colonel. A telephonist measures out mouthfuls of\\r\\nconversation to a military post that sends in observations and receives\\r\\nours. Long time or short time, for here hours and minutes are alike, here\\r\\nis a magic that ends too soon. We must go.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonel would have been perfect if he had not made it a point of\\r\\nhonor to avoid all danger for his civilian visitor. In the morning he had\\r\\ntried to forbid me a flying visit to the marvellous castle of Pinion,\\r\\nbut he finally understood that even a soldier has to be born a civilian\\r\\nand that he should not therefore scorn his own origin. The trip was\\r\\naccomplished without the shadow of an incident, but the colonel, who\\r\\ninsists more than ever on the rights and privileges of the uniform, will\\r\\nnot permit me to return until the Boche cannon favors us with a little\\r\\nrespite. The Boche can hardly make up his mind to such a favor; hence,\\r\\nseveral false departures and changings of direction. Finally, the colonel\\r\\nlets us go under the guard of a robust sergeant-major, who even yesterday\\r\\nmagnificently led his stretcher-bearers to the aid of the wounded under\\r\\nthe hottest fire. Although he is not of the youngest class, he has\\r\\nrefused to be retired from the front. He is spoken of only with respect,\\r\\nI might say admiration. “He goes everywhere.” He is fine, genial company.\\r\\nAfter many necessary little zigzags, a walk that is not very strenuous\\r\\nand very soon over, I left the brave sergeant, whom I shall always\\r\\nremember.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot finish this inconsequent account without speaking of the\\r\\ntouching ceremony which I witnessed at Soissons, the terribly bombarded.\\r\\nSince the victory of Malmaison the city has been out of range. But when\\r\\nyou have seen the building of the sub-prefect tottering with shell-holes,\\r\\na building that neither the sub-prefect nor his wife has left, the\\r\\nshortest walk will tell you a long tale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general, who is a good fellow—I take pleasure in saying that—had\\r\\nproposed to show me something, and so here I am in a public square having\\r\\nthe imposing silhouette of the cathedral as a background. From the\\r\\nheight of the great towers, with their wide wounds, history, attentive,\\r\\nlooks down. Everywhere there is a formidable display of cannon taken\\r\\nfrom the enemy. There are piles of them, heaps of them. There are too\\r\\nmany to count, together with a bewildering mass of trench instruments\\r\\nof all sorts. Can you believe it? They do not hold the eye. How is that\\r\\npossible? Because on the sidewalk opposite, in splendid alignment, is\\r\\nthe gorgeous gathering of soldiers with medals and decorations who have\\r\\ncaptured these things. Ah! They hold the eye! There they are, with all\\r\\nsorts of faces and from all branches of the service, with the flag which\\r\\nthey have followed into battle and which now must be present at their\\r\\nhonor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be quite honest, the group is not so æsthetic as a picture of\\r\\nVersailles. These men are too great for much ceremony. With a jerky step\\r\\nthe general advances; his brusque movements reveal the homage of his\\r\\nemotion before the bravest of the brave. Slowly he passes along the\\r\\nline, while the adjutant reads in a stirring voice the high deeds in\\r\\nthe citations. And the military medal quivers on each noble breast at\\r\\nthe recollection of the tremendous drama lived through. And the general\\r\\nutters a comrade’s congratulation, shakes a friendly hand, expresses a\\r\\ngood wish. Then the flag salutes, while the drums rumble in these hearts\\r\\ndrunk with love of country. At the greeting of the flag of the glorious\\r\\nChasseurs, a rag torn by machine guns, something gets hold of our\\r\\nthroats, which the trumpets hurt with their sublime peal. If there are\\r\\nmore beautiful spectacles, I do not know them. One minute here is worth\\r\\nyears.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I have said nothing of the people about, silent, all in mourning,\\r\\ntheir souls full of tears, which finally brim over. Men, hats off,\\r\\nmotionless as statues, proud of becoming great through their children.\\r\\nMothers, with seared faces, superbly stoic under the eye of the greater\\r\\nmaternity of the great country. The children in the ecstasy of feeling\\r\\nabout them something greater than they can understand, but already\\r\\ncertain that they will understand some day this immortal hour. And not a\\r\\ncry, not a word sounds in the air, nothing but the great silence of the\\r\\ncourage of all of them. Then everyone goes away, firm and erect, to a\\r\\nglorious destiny. In every heart La France has passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n    NOTE.—A few days before M. Clemenceau, premier of France, was\\r\\n    called to power, he returned from a visit to the Aisne front\\r\\n    and published his impressions in his paper, _L’Homme Enchainé_,\\r\\n    now _L’Homme Libre_. When he became premier, _L’Illustration_\\r\\n    republished this “Tribute to the Soldiers of France,” and it\\r\\n    has since been widely reproduced and admired throughout France.\\r\\n    The present English translation by Harry Kurz was printed\\r\\n    in the _New York Tribune_, to the editors of which grateful\\r\\n    acknowledgment is made for permission to reprint here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPREFACE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant-Major Georges Lafond, of the Territorial Hussars, the author of\\r\\nthis book, was in South America at the time of mobilization. He returned\\r\\nto France as soon as possible and joined his corps, but asked to be\\r\\nassigned as intelligence officer to the machine-gun sections of the ...\\r\\nfirst regiment of Colonial Infantry.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this picked corps, which has been decimated several times, he took\\r\\npart in the engagements in Champagne, on the Somme, at Lihons, Dompierre,\\r\\nHerbécourt, and notably in the days from the first to the fifth of\\r\\nJuly, where the regiment earned its second citation and received the\\r\\n_fourragère_.\\r\\n\\r\\nLafond was discharged after the battles of Maisonnette, and wrote this\\r\\nbook of recollections in the hospital at Abbeville, and afterwards at\\r\\nMontpellier, where he had to undergo a severe operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant-Major Lafond’s narrative makes no claim to literary pretension,\\r\\nbut it is simply a collection of actual occurrences. It is a series of\\r\\nshort narratives which give the life of a company of machine gunners from\\r\\nthe day of its formation to the hour when it was so decimated that it had\\r\\nto be reorganized with men from other corps.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat pictures the following titles call to mind: “A Reconnaissance in the\\r\\nFog,” “The Aeroplane,” “Our First Engagement,” “‘We Have Taken a Picket\\r\\nPost,’” “The Attack,” “The Echelon,” “A Water Patrol”! No man who has\\r\\nlived at the front and has taken part in an attack will fail to recognize\\r\\nthe accuracy of these narratives and to experience, as well, emotion,\\r\\nenthusiasm, and pride in having been among “those who were there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis record of adventure was very successful when it appeared in\\r\\nthe _Petit Parisien_, and I feel sure that it will be successful in\\r\\nbook form. I beg Sergeant-Major Georges Lafond to accept my hearty\\r\\ncongratulations on his fine talent and his bravery.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                     MAURICE BARRÈS,\\r\\n                                                 _of the French Academy_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONTENTS\\r\\n\\r\\n    CHAPTER                                   PAGE\\r\\n\\r\\n        I THE SEARCH FOR MY COMPANY              1\\r\\n\\r\\n       II THE QUARTERMASTER’S BILLETS           11\\r\\n\\r\\n      III THE ECHELON                           21\\r\\n\\r\\n       IV THE SONG OF THE MACHINE GUN           31\\r\\n\\r\\n        V A RECONNAISSANCE IN THE FOG           47\\r\\n\\r\\n       VI OUR FIRST ENGAGEMENT                  58\\r\\n\\r\\n      VII EASTER EGGS                           71\\r\\n\\r\\n     VIII THE AEROPLANE                         89\\r\\n\\r\\n       IX DAYS IN CANTONMENT                   103\\r\\n\\r\\n        X AN ORDINARY FATIGUE PARTY            122\\r\\n\\r\\n       XI WITH MUSIC                           135\\r\\n\\r\\n      XII “WE HAVE TAKEN A PICKET POST”        148\\r\\n\\r\\n     XIII A NIGHT CONVOY                       164\\r\\n\\r\\n      XIV THE SONGS OF THE HOMELAND            175\\r\\n\\r\\n       XV A WATER PATROL                       188\\r\\n\\r\\n      XVI A COMMANDER                          199\\r\\n\\r\\n     XVII THE ATTACK                           217\\r\\n\\r\\n    XVIII WITH ORDERS                          232\\r\\n\\r\\n      XIX A WREATH                             250\\r\\n\\r\\n       XX DISCHARGED                           261\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nILLUSTRATIONS\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                                PAGE\\r\\n\\r\\n    “HE’S HIT,” SERGEANT LACE CRIES SUDDENLY.

It was snowing and the fields of\\r\\nPicardy were one vast white carpet on which the auto-trucks traced a\\r\\nmultitude of black lines to the accompaniment of pyrotechnics of mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days before I had left my depot in a small garrison town in\\r\\nthe center of Provence, which lay smiling in the sun and already\\r\\nbedecked with the first flowers of spring. At Lyons I found rain, at\\r\\nSaint-Just-en-Chaussee, snow, and I got off the train in a sea of mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dim light of a February dawn, the station at Villers appeared\\r\\nto be encumbered with the supplies of half-a-dozen regiments. My car\\r\\nwas high on its wheels and at the end of the train farthest from the\\r\\nunloading platform. At the other end of the platform near the entrance to\\r\\nthe station, I found a rolling bridge for unloading animals, but it was\\r\\nuseless to ask those busy people to help me push this weighty contrivance\\r\\nto the car.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I looked at Kiki—Kiki is my horse—who had but recently arrived from\\r\\nCanada and was scarcely broken after his two months’ training at the\\r\\ndepot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kiki, _mon vieux_,” I said, “you must make up your mind to do as I did\\r\\nand jump. Remember that you are a Canadian, and every self-respecting\\r\\nCanadian should know how to jump as soon as he is born.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI delivered this kind invitation from the ground and I urged him on by\\r\\npulling on the reins. Kiki was not at all frightened. He came to the edge\\r\\nof the car, snuffed the air, carefully calculated the distance, bent\\r\\nlightly on his hind legs, and jumped to the ground without a flutter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The ... first Colonials?” the military commissioner said to me. “I don’t\\r\\nknow exactly, but you’ll find it somewhere along twenty or thirty miles\\r\\nto the east at Proyart or Harbonnières, or perhaps at Morcourt. There’s a\\r\\nlittle of it all about there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Kiki and I, in the morning mist, went slowly along roads covered with\\r\\nsnow and grease in search of the second company of machine guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nProyart is a small village hidden in a hollow of this plain of Picardy\\r\\nwhich from a distance resembled a well-stretched, vast white carpet. Here\\r\\nthe villages are sheltered in depressions and one only sees them when he\\r\\nreaches the level of their steeples. It was at Proyart that altogether\\r\\naccidentally, thanks to a sign about as large as my hand and already\\r\\npartly rubbed out, I found the staff of the ... first Colonials.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn orderly condescended to move a few steps and point out to me at the\\r\\nend of the street to the right the billets of the quartermaster of the\\r\\nsecond company of machine guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a court—a sewer, as a matter of fact—which was completely\\r\\nfilled by a pool of filth which left only a narrow passage of a foot or\\r\\ntwo by each wall. In a corner was a tangle of barrels, farm implements,\\r\\nand broken boxes, and on that a mass of wet straw, manure, snow, and mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the farther end of the court was a small door with glass panels—with\\r\\na glass panel—for only one remained. The spaces were conveniently filled\\r\\nby thick layers of the _Petit Parisien_, _Matin_, _Le Journal_, _Echo de\\r\\nParis_, the great dailies which arrived intermittently at Proyart.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went in. Kiki wanted to go in, too, but the door was low and he was\\r\\ncarrying his complete pack. Inside was a ruined kitchen. The chimney\\r\\nstill remained, and there was a large table made of a door stretched\\r\\non two barrels, which took up the middle of the room. In each corner,\\r\\nagainst the walls, were improvised beds, straw mattresses, and heaps of\\r\\nclothes under which I surmised there were bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The door, nom de Dieu!” shouted a voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn front of the chimney was a man struggling desperately with a fire.\\r\\nThe watersoaked wood refused to burn, and the man flooded it with shoe\\r\\ngrease, which, when it melted, threw out jets of yellow flame and filled\\r\\nthe room with a pungent odor and smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The door, the door! What did he tell you!” cried in different tones\\r\\nvoices which came from the heaps of covers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true that a breath of cold air and a swirl of snow had rushed into\\r\\nthe smoky dark hall when I came in. I shut the door and asked,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is this the second company of machine guns?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What of it? What do you want of the second machine guns? It’s here. And\\r\\nafter that what do you want? Papers, again? Zut! They have no idea of\\r\\nbothering people at this hour. Leave them on the table and come back in\\r\\nhalf an hour.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis diatribe emanated from a pile thicker than the rest, in the chimney\\r\\ncorner. At this obsession of papers, of lists to be signed, I guessed he\\r\\nwas a sergeant or a quartermaster, and I kept on:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t worry. There are no papers. I am the mounted intelligence officer\\r\\nattached to this company.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“M ...!” shouted several voices in the four corners of the room, while I\\r\\nwatched arms and muffled heads rise up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Mince!_ So we have a mounted officer now! Wonderful! They’re certainly\\r\\nfitting us out in style. What won’t they do next? Then, that’s all right,\\r\\n_vieux_. Come on in and let us see you. And you have a horse? Where is\\r\\nyour horse? Bring him in; make him come. It must be cold out in the\\r\\ncourt.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first burst of curiosity soon passed, the torrent of words exhausted\\r\\nitself, and the forms which had stirred a moment ago quieted down anew. A\\r\\nmore peremptory voice now started in shouting invectives at the orderly\\r\\nwho was still struggling with the rebellious wood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say, Dedouche. Do you think we’re Boche sausages that you want to smoke\\r\\nus out? Don’t you know anything? We’ll have to wear glasses. That’s no\\r\\nway to light a fire. What did you learn when you were a boy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The grease is full of water and won’t even burn.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Use the oil in the lamp, then.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first result of the immediate execution of this order was to fill\\r\\nthe room with a black stifling cloud which was enough to make one weep.\\r\\nIn the middle of this smoke the orderly, Dedouche, coughed, spat,\\r\\nsputtered, while I heard him storm:\\r\\n\\r\\n“In God’s name, how that stinks! How that stinks!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quartermaster, doubtless on account of the smoke and the smell, now\\r\\ndeigned to get up. He was a young man, large, light complexioned, and his\\r\\nchecks were red and fat. He had just a suspicion of a moustache. His ears\\r\\nwere hidden in a cap which had wings that pulled down. One could scarcely\\r\\nsee his eyes they were so puffed out with sleep and smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you’re the intelligence officer? Sit down. Dedouche, make a cup of\\r\\ncoffee. I’ll make a note of your transfer, and then you can try to find a\\r\\nplace for yourself until the lieutenant comes. Oh, you’ve time, you know.\\r\\nHe never comes before ten o’clock.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, Quartermaster, it’s nearly ten now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, you’re joking. Ten o’clock. My word, it’s true. Oh, there, get\\r\\nup all of you. It’s ten o’clock. And that salaud of a Dedouche hasn’t\\r\\nlighted the fire. Come, come, hurry up, the lieutenant is coming!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as though this were the magic word, the lieutenant came in, leaving\\r\\nthe door wide open behind him. It was time; they were almost suffocated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant was a large man, thin and well set up. His bearing\\r\\nindicated resolution. His brown hair was cut very short, according to\\r\\nthe regulations. A close-cropped black moustache streaked his sunburned\\r\\nface. The general effect of his personality was that of a man cool and\\r\\nheadstrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, he has the coolness of a Colonial,” the machine gunners repeated _ad\\r\\nnauseam_.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Isn’t there any way to get you up?” exclaimed the lieutenant. “You ought\\r\\nto be ashamed of yourselves. It’s after ten o’clock.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he saw me through the cloud of smoke and questioned me with a\\r\\nglance. The quartermaster broke in before I could reply,\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the mounted intelligence officer, Lieutenant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, good!... Good morning.... Welcome.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe extended a large, vigorous hand which confirmed the first impression\\r\\nof his personality—frankness and will.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you found a place for your horse?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not yet, Lieutenant. I’ve just come.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI pointed out Kiki through the door to the courtyard where he waited,\\r\\nstoically and calmly, under the snow. Perhaps he remembered the times\\r\\nnot long ago that he waited for hours at the doors of the ranch under\\r\\nmore wintry winds. Perhaps he imagined that he was still waiting for the\\r\\nrough Canadian pioneer who tarried for long discussions about business,\\r\\nwarming himself the while with whiskey. At any rate Kiki waited stoically\\r\\nand quietly. He scarcely condescended to welcome us by a glance when I\\r\\npresented him to the lieutenant, who stroked his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is Kiki, Lieutenant. I don’t know his real name, for his record\\r\\nbore only his number, but that fits him and he seems to like it. He is\\r\\na Canadian, seven years old, thin but strong, very gentle and a good\\r\\njumper.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s pretty. Come along. We’ll put him in with mine. They’ll get along\\r\\nall right together.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I took Kiki by the bridle and the lieutenant and I went along talking,\\r\\nuntil we reached an improvised stable where the officer’s horse and his\\r\\ngroom were quartered.\\r\\n\\r\\nZèbre was a great brown horse, with a huge, calm face. Everything here\\r\\ncertainly gives an impression of calmness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took leave of the officer for the time being and returned to the\\r\\nquartermaster’s, where a steaming soup and scalding coffee were waiting\\r\\nfor me. It was nearly noon and I had eaten nothing hot for the last\\r\\nforty-eight hours. It was four above zero and it was time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE QUARTERMASTER’S BILLETS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seated under a shed of loose boards in the courtyard of Cantonment\\r\\nNo. 77, and just tasting some excellent macaroni which the cook had\\r\\nwarmed up for me, when Dedouche, the orderly, came to find me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say, Sergeant,” he asked, “are you the intelligence officer?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title of “sergeant” sounds strange in the ears of a cavalryman, and\\r\\nI felt a little hurt in my _esprit de corps_; but I at once answered\\r\\nDedouche’s summons, for the orderly, in spite of being at the beck and\\r\\ncall of everyone, enjoys a certain prestige. He has a real importance,\\r\\nsmall though it be, but an importance which carries weight when he gives\\r\\nhis opinion in the discussions of the “little staff” of the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis staff is the household of the quartermaster’s billets.\\r\\nWith some slight differences it is in general composed of the\\r\\nquartermaster-sergeant, lacking a sergeant-major which companies of\\r\\nmachine guns rarely have, a quartermaster-corporal, an adjutant and\\r\\na mess corporal. I was admitted to the honor of taking part in the\\r\\ndiscussions of the staff on account of the detached and unusual character\\r\\nof my duties.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Dedouche was summoning me. I turned and observed him leisurely.\\r\\nDedouche is an excellent fellow. Without even knowing him one would guess\\r\\nit at first glance. He is good-natured, never in a hurry, no matter\\r\\nhow urgent his errand, and indifferent alike to blows and invectives.\\r\\nHe smiles under torrents of abuse and threats of the most terrible\\r\\npunishments, and does his duty as man of all work silently. In a word, he\\r\\npossesses all the qualities inherent in his duty. He is tall and spare;\\r\\nhis face is beardless and sanctimonious; his eyes smile, but they look\\r\\nfar away under his great round glasses with their large rims. All in all\\r\\nDedouche looks like a lay brother. To complete the illusion, when he\\r\\ntalks he has a habit of thrusting his hands into the large sleeves of his\\r\\njacket and lowering his head to look over his spectacles. In civil life\\r\\nDedouche was an assistant in a pharmacy in one of the large provincial\\r\\ncities. He knows the art of making up learned formulae. His long slim\\r\\nfingers manage the most fragile things with skill, and his grave voice is\\r\\naccustomed to the mezzotints of the laboratory.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” I answered at last, “it is I.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The lieutenant wants you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI gulped down my plate of macaroni in two mouthfuls, swallowed the\\r\\ncoffee which the cook, already attentive to my wants, held out to me,\\r\\nand followed Dedouche the two hundred yards which separated us from the\\r\\nbillets.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo hundred yards is nothing, and yet it is a world. In less time than it\\r\\ntakes to tell it I learned a mass of things from Dedouche.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, what part of the country we are from. The ... first Colonials\\r\\nwas organized in the South. So, in the hope of finding in each newcomer\\r\\nanother “countryman,” Dedouche asked the new arrival at once,\\r\\n\\r\\n“What part of the country are you from?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had some doubt about my reply. A Hussar of a regiment with an unknown\\r\\nnumber, who had given little opportunity to study his accent, might be a\\r\\nman from the North or the East. “One never knows with these cavalrymen,”\\r\\nhe seemed to say, “they’re so uncertain.” So he changed the form and\\r\\nvaried his traditional question somewhat,\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re not from the South, by chance, Sergeant?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this repetition of his offense about my title, I thought that I ought\\r\\nto slip in a discreet observation, so I said,\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the cavalry, my friend, the sergeant is called ‘_maréchal des\\r\\nlogis_.’” And then having satisfied my slightly offended _esprit de\\r\\ncorps_, I replied, “Yes, mon _vieux_, I am from the South, in fact from\\r\\nthe Mediterranean, from L’Herault.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How things happen!” exclaimed Dedouche. “I’m from Le Clapas.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLe Clapas is the nickname given to Montpellier in the territory. And\\r\\nat that there came all at once a bewildering flow of words. Dedouche\\r\\nbegan to tell me, mixing it all up in an incredible confusion, about his\\r\\nbirthplace, his adventures, his former regular occupation, in the depths\\r\\nof a pharmacy in a small street under the shadow of the University, his\\r\\ntransfer from the auxiliary to active service, his wound in Champagne.\\r\\nAll this was interspersed with frequent exclamations and repetitions,\\r\\n“Say, tell me, _Maréchal_, will this war ever be over?” and then regrets\\r\\nfor his home land, “Say, tell me, _Logis_, wouldn’t it be better down\\r\\nthere in the good sun?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these different attempts to get nearer to the term “_maréchal de\\r\\nlogis_,” I observed Dedouche’s obvious good will, but what interested me\\r\\nmost was a little advance knowledge about the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Dedouche sketched in a few words a picture of it, which was absolutely\\r\\naccurate, as I was able to appreciate later.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The lieutenant is a very chic type. No one would think to look at him\\r\\nthat he is from the South, too. He appears cold and hard, like that,\\r\\nbut it’s not natural; he puts it on. He’s good-hearted at bottom.\\r\\nHe’s a Basque and isn’t afraid of anything. You ought to have seen\\r\\nhim in Champagne at Massiges. Oh, and then we have besides his fellow\\r\\ncountryman, Sub-Lieutenant Delpos, a blond. He’s not here now; he’s down\\r\\nat Morcourt with the echelon. He’s a type too, not stuck-up, but he’s\\r\\nagreeable and good-humored.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, those in the billets,” Dedouche sketched with a vague wave of the\\r\\nhand, as if to say something like this: “They’re of no importance;\\r\\nthey’re brothers, friends, and not worth talking about.” Perhaps his\\r\\ngesture meant something else, but that’s what I thought it meant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as if he were responding to my implied question, he went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n“—there is only the drummer who’s from the South, too; he’s what they\\r\\ncall the ‘quartermaster corporal,’ I don’t know why. He’s a good fellow,\\r\\nbut he does not talk. At least he only talks rarely, and he’s from\\r\\nMarseilles, too; no one would think it to see him. He makes me mad most\\r\\nof the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, the rest! The corporal of infantry is from Paris. I don’t know him.\\r\\nHe only came five or six days ago. He hasn’t told us anything yet; he\\r\\nonly sings. And what songs! Good God, they’re enough to make one blush!\\r\\n\\r\\n“The _juteux_—the adjutant,” interrupted Dedouche, for he rarely used\\r\\nslang. With the exception of “_pinard_” and “_tacot_,” which have become\\r\\nhallowed and have taken an official place even in the most refined\\r\\nlanguage of the armies, Dedouche rarely used a vulgar or misplaced word\\r\\nin his conversation. This was not because he was opposed to it nor from\\r\\nfalse modesty, but because his occupation as a “scientist” had given him\\r\\nthe habit of using good language.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The adjutant,” went on Dedouche, “he’s not an adjutant. He’s a\\r\\nbrother, a father, a friend, a man, what! Never a word of anger, never\\r\\na punishment, always agreeable and kind. And in spite of that he’s had\\r\\na career. He’s been in Morocco, China, and Madagascar, and no one knows\\r\\nwhere else. He’s been in the service eleven years, but you wouldn’t think\\r\\nit to look at him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis running biography brought us to the open door which framed the\\r\\nlieutenant’s tall figure.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say, _Margis_” (the lieutenant knew his military terminology and this\\r\\nabbreviation was not without zest), “are you rested from your journey?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wasn’t tired, Lieutenant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How about your horse?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No more than I was. Do you think that after three days stretched out on\\r\\nthe straw in his car, without moving ...?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, if you are willing, we’ll both go to the echelon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, Lieutenant.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA question must have framed itself on my face, for he added almost at\\r\\nonce:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, the echelon, the fighting train, the cavalry. You’ll be more at\\r\\nhome there. We left it below at Morcourt, seven or eight miles away, on\\r\\naccount of the shells that fall here sometimes. Horses, you know, cost\\r\\nmore than men, so we have to economize them. It is understood, then?\\r\\nWe’ll go about noon. Saddle both horses. Meet me here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he strode off and joined a group of officers who were coming up the\\r\\nmain street of the village to the church.\\r\\n\\r\\nDedouche was already full of attention for me—just think of a man from\\r\\nhome on the “little staff”—and he now burst forth eagerly:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t trouble yourself, _Logis_. I’ll tell the groom to saddle the\\r\\nhorses and bring them here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smoke still persisted in the dark, littered confusion of the room,\\r\\nbut combined with it now was an odor of burnt grease mixed with the moldy\\r\\nsmell of a ragout with onions and strong cheese. In addition, spread out\\r\\non the table, were the remnants of a meal, which had just been finished,\\r\\nthe rolls, the account books and reports.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quartermaster-corporal, the silent fellow from Marseilles, immersed\\r\\nin reading _Le Soleil du Midi_, did not even condescend to look up. In\\r\\nresponse to my friendly good-by, he let a scarcely perceptible “adieu”\\r\\nslip through his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quartermaster was stretched out on a dirty mattress thrown on the\\r\\nground, and juggling two packages of English cigarettes, while he sang at\\r\\nthe top of his lungs—and what a voice he had!—the latest song:\\r\\n\\r\\n        _Mes amis, dans la vie_\\r\\n    _Faut faire des économies_\\r\\n        _Les journaux vous l’ont dit._\\r\\n        _C’est aussi mon avis._\\r\\n\\r\\nThis intellectual refrain must have given him extreme pleasure, for he\\r\\nbegan it again and again without any interruption.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” I said, “judging from the looks of things, you aren’t often\\r\\ndisturbed here?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this the drummer cast me a searching look, cold, disdainful and\\r\\ncommiserating, as much as to say to me,\\r\\n\\r\\n“One can see that you’ve just come!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the quartermaster, he replied to everything in the repertoire of\\r\\nthe _Eldorado_. Without stopping his juggling, he shouted at me in his\\r\\namazing voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n        _Moi! je m’en fous,_\\r\\n    _Je reste tranquil’ment_\\r\\n        _Dans mon trou!..._\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was going on when the infernal noise of some aerial trolley tore\\r\\nthrough space.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Attention!” he cried, without moving from his mattress. “There’s the\\r\\nMetro!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost at the same moment, a great shell, a “310” at least, burst in the\\r\\ncourt of the house opposite, demolished the roof, and crushed a dozen\\r\\nhorses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adjutant was just crossing the street and he stopped at the door to\\r\\nestimate the damage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They missed the steeple again,” he said, with a disdainful shrug for the\\r\\nBoche artillery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Morin, the drummer, by way of commentary, without interrupting his\\r\\nreading:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Close the door. If they send any more shells, that will make a draft.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ECHELON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Proyart to Morcourt is five miles by a crossroad which in its many\\r\\ncurves and windings cuts across trenches, communication trenches and\\r\\nbarbed wire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow had stopped, but it still covered the ground, the trees and the\\r\\nfarms with its regular white covering. The communication trenches showed\\r\\nblack on this vast screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crows circled in innumerable flights and sought in vain for the\\r\\ncarrion which had been so abundant for months and which, to-day, was\\r\\nburied.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went along, boot to boot, slowly, for the roads were slippery. Kiki\\r\\nwanted to dance about, for the keen air made him lively. But Zèbre’s\\r\\nsedateness dismayed him, and Kiki wisely ranged alongside and regulated\\r\\nthe pace by his.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant talked but little—a few detached words, chopped phrases,\\r\\nabout the company, an observation on the weather, a reflection on the\\r\\nhorses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road was almost deserted save for a few Territorials, muffled in\\r\\ntheir sheepskins, who dragged along their heavy wooden shoes which were\\r\\nmade even higher by a thick sole of snow. From time to time a company\\r\\nwagon, driven like an express train, grazed us with its wheels and\\r\\nsplashed us with mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, abruptly, without having had to climb the slightest hill, we saw\\r\\nMorcourt, as one sees suddenly from the top of a cliff the sea at his\\r\\nfeet, in the midst of the thousand windings of the Somme, of the canal\\r\\nand the turf-pits. Morcourt is a village scarcely as large as Proyart,\\r\\nand like it hidden in a gully sheltered from the winds on all sides, and\\r\\nalso like it, hidden under the snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nA blacksmith had set up his forge in the open air against the walls of\\r\\na tottering tile-kiln. All around the snow had melted in great black\\r\\npuddles where the waiting horses had pawed the ground. The smoke from his\\r\\nfire rose red-tinted and dark in the heavy air which seemed to muffle the\\r\\nring of the hammers on the anvil.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe come to a stop before a house nearly in ruins, whose tottering\\r\\nremains are a constant menace. A corporal rushes out—nimble, short and\\r\\nthick-set, a small Basque cap binding his sunburned forehead—and then\\r\\nsome men come from the neighboring stables.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe houses in the country which were invaded for a short time and in\\r\\nwhich troops have had their cantonments for long weary months all look\\r\\nalike. Their doors and windows are gone, but these are replaced by tent\\r\\ncanvas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drivers of the echelon and the war train in the machine-gun companies\\r\\nare nearly always sailors, the older classes of the Territorials, who\\r\\nafter many changes have been assigned to the Colonial regiments. No one\\r\\nknows why, but it is probably because the bureaucratic, stay-at-home\\r\\nmental worker finds some relationship between the Colonials and the\\r\\nsea. And so they make these men, accustomed to the management of ships,\\r\\ninfantrymen, or drivers, or even cavalrymen. But with the unfailing\\r\\nreadiness and the ingenuity of their kind they make up so much for all\\r\\nthat, that far from appearing unready and badly placed, one would say\\r\\nthat they were veterans already broken to all the tricks of the trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir long ship voyages and the necessities of critical hours have taught\\r\\nthem to replace with the means at hand most things in material existence.\\r\\nFrom an old preserve box and a branch of a tree, squared and split with\\r\\na hatchet, they make a strong and convenient table. With a scantling and\\r\\na bit of wire lattice taken from a fence, they make an elastic mattress\\r\\nwhich, covered with straw and canvas, becomes a very comfortable bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sailor is carpenter: the hatchet in his hand takes the place of the\\r\\nmost ingenious tools of the joiner; painter: he has painted and refitted\\r\\nhis boat from its tarry keel to the scroll work of the bulwarks and the\\r\\nfigures and the beloved words they put on the stern; mender: he mends his\\r\\nsails and nets artistically; cook: during the long days at sea on his\\r\\nfrail craft with its limited accommodations, he makes the most savory\\r\\ndishes from the fruits of his fishing and a few simple spices. His\\r\\nqualities and his knowledge are numerous and wide: astronomer and healer,\\r\\nand, as well, singer of beautiful songs which cradle his thought at the\\r\\nwill of the rhythms, as the sea rocks his boat at the will of the waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in this multiplicity of talents he lacks that of a driver, and what\\r\\nis more, a driver of a machine gun. That is a job which combines the\\r\\nheavy and the mountain artillery. A machine-gun driver should be able to\\r\\ndrive in the saddle the leading team of horses and put the heavy caisson\\r\\nof ammunition through the most difficult evolutions. Again, he should be\\r\\nable to drive on foot the mule loaded with his pack-saddle and through\\r\\nthe most impossible and sometimes the most dangerous paths.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had scarcely begun to swallow a cup of thick, smoking, regulation\\r\\ncoffee in a room of the cantonment, furnished with special skill, when\\r\\nSub-Lieutenant Delpos—smart, carefree, smiling, a cap on the back of his\\r\\nhead and a song on his lips—arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nDedouche’s description seemed to me to be exact. He was indeed a very\\r\\nyoung man, very quick, very blond and very gay. He was already an officer\\r\\nwhen others of his age had scarcely left college; he was already a hero\\r\\ncounting in his active service a thousand feats of prowess when his\\r\\nrather sceptical contemporaries were content to read about them in books.\\r\\nOpen merriment shone in his eyes. He had gained his promotion in the\\r\\nfield far from the stifling atmosphere of study halls. Yesterday he was\\r\\nstill a sergeant in Madagascar, Senegal, and Morocco; to-day he is an\\r\\nofficer who has fought since the beginning of the Great War; to-morrow he\\r\\nwill be a trainer of men. He knows them all; many are his old bedfellows\\r\\nor companions of the column. His remarks are keen and unrhetorical and\\r\\nthey please the men. They love him and fear him; they are free with him\\r\\nand respect him. They know that he understands his trade perfectly and\\r\\nthat they can deceive him in nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur introduction was short and unceremonious. A man brought on the table\\r\\na bottle of very sweet Moselle wine, which is christened at the front\\r\\n“Champagne.” It was one of those wines which make up for their qualities\\r\\nby such pompous appellations and well-intentioned labels as “Champagne de\\r\\nla Victory,” “Champagne de la Revenge,” “of the Allies,” “of the Poilu,”\\r\\n“of Glory.” They are all equally bad, but they make a loud noise when the\\r\\ncork is drawn and most of the wine flows away in sparkling foam.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe drained our cups to the common health, and to the success and certain\\r\\nglory of the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the lieutenant, who has memories of the drama, said in a voice which\\r\\nrecalled the tones of the already classic Carbon de Casteljaloux, his\\r\\nneighbor,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Since my company has, I believe, reached its full number, shall we not\\r\\nshow it to the _logis_, if you please?”\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the rays of an anemic sun which had waited until the hour of sunset\\r\\nbefore it deigned to appear, we made a brief visit to the echelon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst the roll; five corporal muleteers or drivers: Raynal, the owner of\\r\\na vineyard in Gironde; Liniers, a salesman of wines and spirits and a\\r\\ngreat elector in the Twelfth Arrondissement; Glanais, Bonecase, Glorieu,\\r\\ncarpenter, vine-grower, and farmer—and none of them had ever managed a\\r\\nhorse in his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the men—one in fifty is a cavalryman—but that one is perfect. He was\\r\\ntrained at the cavalry school at Saumur; trained horses and bred them,\\r\\nso they at once turned him over to the echelon, where he had to lead a\\r\\nmule by the bridle. That, of course, was a reproach to his old trade,\\r\\nso in default of any other satisfaction it taught him the philosophy of\\r\\nresignation and peaceful blessedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cavalry!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, the cavalry, that’s been posing five minutes,” said Sub-Lieutenant\\r\\nDelpos—he was extremely fond of that expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were horses and mules varying in age from five to seventeen. They\\r\\nwere all sensible, settled down, their legs somewhat worn out, and more\\r\\naccustomed to the hearse than to a caisson, and more familiar with the\\r\\nsong of the worker than with the roar of cannon. They were all gentle,\\r\\nonly demanding oats and straw; some with their bones sticking out of\\r\\ntheir hides, while others were still sleek and shiny from their warm\\r\\nstables and fresh straw; all unconscious of what awaited them on the\\r\\nmorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the mules was a veteran, an enormous, cunning animal. His hair\\r\\nwas short and rough, and in places there were great patches where the\\r\\nhide showed. His skin was hung on a projecting framework of bones, and,\\r\\nalthough he was well fed, he was very thin—with a thinness so unyielding\\r\\nto rations that it was impossible to get him fat. His head was that of\\r\\nan epicurean philosopher with deep mocking eyes. This was Chocolate.\\r\\n\\r\\nChocolate is beyond the time when he has an age. The oldest soldiers\\r\\nin the regiment have always known him, even at Marrakech and Rabbat in\\r\\nMorocco.\\r\\n\\r\\nChocolate has made many campaigns during his active service and he has\\r\\nreceived several wounds as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story goes that one day in Morocco Chocolate got loose from\\r\\nthe bivouac, and started browsing on the grass and wild oats in an\\r\\nambuscade—between two fires. Absolutely indifferent to the crackling\\r\\nof bullets which he had known from infancy, he continued to lop off\\r\\nthe plants until the pernicious bullets began to graze his skin. Then\\r\\nhe stretched out at full length in a hollow in the sand and browsed on\\r\\nthe grass within reach of his teeth, while he waited the end of the\\r\\nadventure. Then he went back to the bivouac in search of a pail of water\\r\\nand a bag of oats.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Chocolate is the file leader. He indicates by his example to the\\r\\nhorses whom the pack-saddle galls that the best way of carrying it is to\\r\\navoid romping to the right and the left, shifting about, and trotting,\\r\\nin fact, all movements which misplace the saddle or wrinkle the skin\\r\\nbeneath. The secret is to work soberly, slowly and at an even pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nChocolate belongs to a family of mules which ranks high in history. The\\r\\nbroad, rounded backs of his ancestors have borne debonnair sovereigns,\\r\\npreacher monks, magnificent Sultans and Sancho Panzas, baskets of\\r\\nvegetables and cans of milk. To-day Chocolate, their descendant, carries\\r\\nan infernal instrument—a machine gun. But what matters that to him? The\\r\\nroad rolls on before him and he follows it. There are oats at the end,\\r\\nto-night or to-morrow, what difference does it make?\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is cool,” the drivers say. Coolness is the great secret of the\\r\\nColonials.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoolness, indifference to danger, bad weather, adversity, obstacles,\\r\\ndeath—no nervousness, no useless bursts of anger, no dangerous hurrying,\\r\\nno false starts. It is necessary to go—they will go—they arrive. That is\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SONG OF THE MACHINE GUN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDedouche brings me a note to sign for on the report book. It reads:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The non-commissioned officers will assemble their sections in the\\r\\ncourtyard of Cantonment No. 77 at 2.30. Each gun captain will present his\\r\\ngun. Service marching order, with masks and arms.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI sign mechanically to please Dedouche, who thinks he is showing me a\\r\\nspecial favor by offering me the first reading of all orders and reports.\\r\\nBut this one interests me but little, for I have neither arms nor guns to\\r\\npresent. So it is as a spectator that I am present at the lieutenant’s\\r\\ninspection. This time I shall see the complete company.\\r\\n\\r\\nI find myself at the appointed hour at Cantonment 77.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne must have lived in these remains of villages, which persist in\\r\\nstanding, near the lines to have an exact idea of what they are.\\r\\nIn these villages furious combats have taken place in the streets,\\r\\nfrom house to house, and for two years they have been occupied and\\r\\noverpopulated—a hamlet of one hundred and fifty inhabitants often serves\\r\\nas a cantonment for ten thousand men—by men of all arms of the service,\\r\\nfrom all regions, of all colors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not ruin in all its tragic horror and majesty. It is worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is something which appears to want to live, but which a latent leprosy\\r\\neats away. Often there are traces of shells, the splatter of bullets, the\\r\\nmarks of fire; the roofs may have fallen in from the recent shelling, but\\r\\neven yet the general effect is that the houses on the streets are still\\r\\nstanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fronts of these houses, made of straw and mud, with only a large\\r\\ndoor swinging on its hinges, are whole. Of course the mud has often been\\r\\nscratched in long, leprous wounds, and the straw tumbles out leaving the\\r\\nbare skeleton of worm-eaten wood; and, besides, the windows are without\\r\\nthe glass, which has been broken to bits by the explosion of shells, and\\r\\nwhich is replaced by bits of paper or by calendars. But the real ruin is\\r\\ninside.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the work of the carelessness and negligence of the wandering\\r\\nmultitudes who pass that way, who arrive at evening, tired, muddy, wet,\\r\\nwho fall asleep on damp straw, cut to pieces and crawling with vermin,\\r\\nand who go on the next day, or three days later, leaving as a mark of\\r\\ntheir passing a greater stench and a greater dilapidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ruin is inside. It is not the beautiful ending of destruction by\\r\\nfire, but the slow death by cancer which eats away, by gangrene which\\r\\nmounts from the cattle sheds to the stable, from the stable to the barn,\\r\\nand from the barn to the hearth. And at last a day comes when the front\\r\\nalone is standing on the ruin of the annihilated house, and then men who\\r\\nare passing by, seeing that it is tottering and dangerous, cut it down\\r\\nwith blows of the axe and chop the wood into bits for their little needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so these houses die: houses which under their humble appearance had\\r\\ngreat souls palpitating with life, where lives were born and passed their\\r\\nyears; where joys and griefs exclaimed and wept, where the peasant, the\\r\\nson of the soil, drew from this soil, the generatrix of strong races, the\\r\\nre-vivifying harvests which he stored away in the barn which to-day is\\r\\ndead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhole villages and great villages agonize in this way through months of\\r\\nwearing away, and their end is no less terrible, no less majestic, no\\r\\nless pitiful than of those villages with glorious names which the wrath\\r\\nof shells beats into dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nCantonment 77 is made up of those houses which waste away. Between the\\r\\nfragile walls, notched by an empty barn and a fallen shed, opens a\\r\\ncourtyard. Filth spreads out in a vast pool on which float among the\\r\\nrefuse a pile of garbage, boxes, the waste of cooking and greasy papers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the corner of a recess open to every wind, on piles of bricks held\\r\\ntogether by iron bars pulled from the window sills, the cook has set his\\r\\npots and bowls in line. His fire of wood so green that the sap oozes out\\r\\nlicks the already blackened walls with its long flames.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that offers even a precarious shelter—a roof—is occupied by the men\\r\\nwho crowd in there on old, filthy straw, and on the meager rations of\\r\\nfresh straw, often too fresh. And as the tiles and thatch let the rain\\r\\nfilter through, they stretch above them strips of tent canvas.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, blessed canvas! To what uses is it not put! It serves as a roof\\r\\nagainst bad weather, the rain and snow; a protection against dampness,\\r\\nmud and vermin; planted on two stakes, stretched to a door casing, it\\r\\nprotects the fires for cooking from draughts; in the more comfortable\\r\\ncantonments in the rear, where the straw is clean and abundant, where the\\r\\nmen are at last able to take off their shoes, and their muddy leggings\\r\\nand their trousers heavy with dampness, it serves as the bed clothes;\\r\\nand, finally, at the last hour it is in the tent canvas that they collect\\r\\nthe bodies with their torn and shattered limbs. It serves as shroud and\\r\\ncoffin. And, faithful to its rôle, it is the last shelter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men began to arrive by groups almost in order, at any rate as much so\\r\\nas the littered ground in the courtyard would permit. They assembled by\\r\\nsections in a half circle around the pool of filth. It was certainly a\\r\\npicturesque sight when, at the command “Attention,” these men mounted a\\r\\nfaultless guard around this fetid pool, where, among papers, tossed about\\r\\nand dirty, and box covers, there floated, bloated and fetid, all kinds\\r\\nof carrion, the rats of the last hecatomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the doorway on the largest and cleanest part of the courtyard the\\r\\neight machine guns were drawn up in line.\\r\\n\\r\\nEight machine guns, the armament of the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nEight guns, so small, so fine, and such bits of workmanship, that one\\r\\nwould think to see them that they were a child’s playthings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe machine guns appeared very coquettish and pretty as they rested on\\r\\ntheir bluish-gray tripod, with their steel barrels well burnished even to\\r\\nthe mouth of their muzzles. They hardly appeared at all threatening with\\r\\nthe polished leather of the breech, where the bronzed fist of the gun\\r\\nlayer stood out in graceful designs, and the attenuated round and svelte\\r\\ncircles of the radiator.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: REMAINS OF VILLAGES NEAR THE LINES _See page 36_]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the machine gun is a coquette, too. Under its appearance of delicacy\\r\\nand grace it conceals a terrible power of domination and strength. Yet it\\r\\nhurls pitiless death without noise, with a rapidity as furtive as a shout\\r\\nof laughter, with a tac-tac which is scarcely perceptible and which is\\r\\nno more menacing than the familiar tac-tac of the sewing-machine or the\\r\\ntypewriter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the machine gun is a coquette, too! Fashioned like a work of art,\\r\\nthe brilliancy of its polished steel and the voluptuous roundness of the\\r\\nbrass invite caresses. Its shots come from they know not where, since\\r\\nthey can see nothing—a bush is sufficient to conceal it; light, it is\\r\\nhere one minute and there another; it is not visible until one is almost\\r\\nupon it, yet its shots are fatal at some miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is delicate and costly, needing a hundred things for its adornment,\\r\\nskilled care for its toilet and a hundred men to serve. Is not the\\r\\nmachine gun a coquette?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Company Casanova is of recent formation it received an entirely\\r\\nnew armament of the latest model. The guns are built on the Hotchkiss\\r\\nsystem—the last word of perfection in war. They are light, scarcely\\r\\nfifty pounds, and they are easy to manipulate skilfully. The rapidity of\\r\\ntheir fire is extreme, more than five hundred shots a minute, and their\\r\\nadjustment is such that they can fire on the most varied objects. First,\\r\\nthere is blockade fire, which concentrates all the shots on a narrow\\r\\npoint; then the sweeping fire, which sweeps the whole of an extended\\r\\nfield; and finally, indirect fire, which hits its designated target with\\r\\nmathematical precision, at the same time concealing the source.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe machine gun is the little queen of battles. One may smile to look at\\r\\nher, but one shudders when he thinks of her ravages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the men are proud of their guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nI observe them while the lieutenant speaks to them and their eyes look\\r\\nalternately at the lieutenant and at their respective guns. They know\\r\\ntheir gun; they love her; possess her. They have confidence in her, and\\r\\nit is she who defends them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-day there are about one hundred and fifty men grouped in the same\\r\\nspecialty, from all regions, all regiments, all arms, who have come after\\r\\nmore or less lengthy stays in the instruction camps at Nice, Clermont,\\r\\nand La Valbonne.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir specialty has created among them a certain sort of affinity, a\\r\\nfamily characteristic. Machine gunners are an element apart, a sort of\\r\\nélite. In their ranks there is a certain homogeneity which comes from the\\r\\npractice of the same competency which is nearly a science. They feel\\r\\nsomewhat superior to, at least different from, the ordinary companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey appreciate the worth of their distinction and scarcely ever\\r\\nassociate with other troops. The companies of infantry are swamped in a\\r\\nbattalion, while the companies of machine guns are isolated, autonomous,\\r\\ndirectly dependent on the commanding officer, and they enjoy an absolute\\r\\ninitiative in a battle. Finally, they are not anonymous or numbered;\\r\\nthey are not called the fifth, seventh, or the twelfth, but the “Company\\r\\nCasanova,” as they once said Royal-Piémont or Prince Condé.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, too, there is their insignia. The insignia is the bauble, the\\r\\njewel, of the soldier. It is a real satisfaction to have something on the\\r\\nuniform which distinguishes one from his neighbor. To such a point do\\r\\nthey carry this that many cannot resist putting on insignia to which they\\r\\nhaven’t the slightest right. And none of the insignia arouses greater\\r\\nenvy than the two small intersecting cannons of the machine guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt takes one hundred and fifty men, two officers, ten non-commissioned\\r\\nofficers, and sixty horses to serve, supply and transport the eight small\\r\\nguns, one hundred and fifty men trained and inured to hardship. There is\\r\\nnone here who has not been in several battles and received several wounds\\r\\nin his active service. There is none here who has not a good record. When\\r\\nsaid of one that means little, but when said of all it is worth telling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are artillerymen, cavalrymen, and sailors who have become foot\\r\\nsoldiers through their different changes; and not only are all arms\\r\\nrepresented, but all professions, all classes and all temperaments.\\r\\nJacquet, a poet and musician, a dreamer with an exquisite soul, is\\r\\nan accurate gun layer. Finger drives milk wagons in Paris, but with\\r\\nhis gigantic hands he manipulates with delicacy the wheelwork of his\\r\\nHotchkiss. Millazo, who behind his counter at Hanoï showed gracefully\\r\\nthe jewels of Indo-Chinese art and learned at Lure the meticulous art\\r\\nof watchmaking, now manages a “sweeping” fire as calmly and accurately\\r\\nas he used to mount a spiral spring on its microscopic pivot. Corporal\\r\\nVial, who used to verify accounts in the luxurious banks on the Riviera\\r\\nand handle tinkling gold and checks, here shows that he knows the\\r\\nscience of fire and his machine and leads his squad with authority.\\r\\nCharlet drove the heavy locomotives on the railways of the North; Gamie\\r\\nregulated the powerful looms in the textile factories, and they both owe\\r\\nto their knowledge of mechanics their duties as range takers. Imbert\\r\\nwas a fisherman and, as he knows how to cook a savory bouillabaisse,\\r\\nhe is assigned to the difficult rôle of cook and acquits himself\\r\\nconscientiously and well. However, Chevalier, an expert in geometry,\\r\\nwho for twenty years grew pale in profound studies of logarithms and\\r\\nco-ordinates, here assumes the duties of mess corporal, and discusses\\r\\nwith asperity the supplies and remarks pitilessly on the regulation cup\\r\\nof wine and the mathematical pounds and ounces of mutton, lard and beans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of what one might think, this odd collection of men is as\\r\\nhomogeneous as could be imagined. This comes from the fact that above all\\r\\nthis different knowledge is a uniform purpose, because all these multiple\\r\\nalliances tend toward a common end which is incarnated in their chief,\\r\\na man from the South, who is expansive and impetuous, but who curbs his\\r\\ntemperament under the rigid calm of a man from the North, one of the\\r\\ncommon people, a son of the soil, who has risen to the rank of officer,\\r\\nand a commanding officer at that, solely through persistency and courage.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the lieutenant had finished his rapid but close inspection, and had\\r\\nexamined with the eye of a connoisseur the condition and repair of the\\r\\nguns, he took in the whole company with a look, for it is his work which\\r\\nhe commands with firmness and which he loves. He is already going, after\\r\\naddressing a few remarks to the adjutant and the classic, “All right.\\r\\nBreak ranks,” when a man steps out of the ranks and comes towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lieutenant, the company is now completely equipped and armed, but there\\r\\nis, however, still something lacking.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed,” replied the lieutenant, “and what’s that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Its marching song.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Its marching song! Have you chosen one?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Chosen one! Oh, no! We have an unpublished one, as new as the company\\r\\nitself, composed for us and created by us. Will you do us the honor of\\r\\nlistening to it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will I? The devil. I ask it; I demand it. I want to learn it, too. Go\\r\\non. Start it!” he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then Gaix turned towards his comrades and began to sing in his great\\r\\ndeep baritone voice our marching song, “Ma Mitrailleuse,” which each\\r\\nsection had learned secretly and which they sang together for the first\\r\\ntime to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a rhythm taken from some war march, some one had composed simple\\r\\nwords, which were nevertheless image-provoking and vibrant, where the\\r\\nalternating motet “Ma Mitrailleuse,” sung in chorus, sounds like a bugle\\r\\ncall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis marching song is one of those which engrave themselves at once on\\r\\nthe memory and in the heart, which are never forgotten, for in their\\r\\naccents are rooted the strongest impressions of the hours lived in the\\r\\nsimple brotherhood of arms, the memory of dangers encountered together,\\r\\nthe pride of victories, and the pious homage to those who sang it with us\\r\\nand whose manly voices were silenced forever in the night of battles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I find in writing it the same deep stirring emotion that I\\r\\nexperienced when I first heard it.\\r\\n\\r\\n_MA MITRAILLEUSE_\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Sur notre front, dans ton abri,_\\r\\n    _Tu dors sur ton trépied bleu gris,_\\r\\n    _Calme dans l’ombre vaporeuse,_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse._\\r\\n    _Et ton canon d’acier bleui_\\r\\n    _Benoîtement perce la nuit._\\r\\n    _Que tu parais peu dangereuse,_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse._\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Si parfois en te transportant_\\r\\n    _Je trouve ton poids fatigant,_\\r\\n    _Et dis tout bas “la sacré gueuse!”_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse,_\\r\\n    _Pardonne-moi, car j’ai grand tort,_\\r\\n    _Sachant que tu chantes la mort_\\r\\n    _De l’Allemagne furieuse,_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse._\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Mais dans le petit jour blêmi,_\\r\\n    _Alerte! Voici l’ennemi!_\\r\\n    _Et t’éveillant soudain rageuse,_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse,_\\r\\n    _Avec tes tac tac réguliers_\\r\\n    _Fauche les Boches par milliers,_\\r\\n    _Sans t’arrêter, noire et fumeuse,_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse._\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Et comme nous elle attendra_\\r\\n    _Le grand jour qui déclanchera_\\r\\n    _L’offensive victorieuse,_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse._\\r\\n    _Poursuivant le bandit germain,_\\r\\n    _J’entendrai sur les bords du Rhin,_\\r\\n    _Au grand soleil, claquer joyeuse_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse._\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the last accents, sung by the men at the top of their lungs, died\\r\\naway, there was silence and I looked at the lieutenant.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was seated on a staircase, with his head leaning on his clenched\\r\\nfists. He had listened to the whole song, and now he remained for a\\r\\nmoment as if waiting. And when he stood up his eyes were slightly red and\\r\\nhis lips concealed under a smile the impress of intense emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is good,” he said, “very beautiful, my friends, and I congratulate\\r\\nyou all. Your song is admirable, it will go with us everywhere, and we\\r\\nwill lead it to victory. But who is the author? There must be an author.\\r\\nThe devil, there must be an author!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a moment of silence as if each one hesitated to reply, but a\\r\\nbig sergeant cried out in a stentorian voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n“A _ban_ for the author, Lieutenant Delpos, and a couplet for him\\r\\nbesides.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the men broke all alignment, pressed around their young\\r\\nsub-lieutenant, joyous, proud and blushing with pleasure, weeping with\\r\\njoy, and burst out at the top of their lungs, with indescribable feeling,\\r\\nwhich showed all their strength, their will for victory and their\\r\\nunbreakable confidence:\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Et comme nous elle attendra_\\r\\n    _Le grand jour qui déclanchera_\\r\\n    _L’offensive victorieuse,_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse._\\r\\n    _Poursuivant le bandit germain,_\\r\\n    _J’entendrai sur les bords du Rhin,_\\r\\n    _Au grand soleil, claquer joyeuse_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse._\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, amidst the applause and the “vivats,” the lieutenant embraced his\\r\\nyoung friend vigorously and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nom de Dieu! You didn’t tell me that you were a poet. I congratulate\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd taking him by the arm, he went off joyous, skipping like a gamin,\\r\\ntaking up again the inspiring refrain:\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Ma Mitrailleuse ... Ma Mitrailleuse!_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nA RECONNAISSANCE IN THE FOG\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening the lieutenant said to me a little after dinner:\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow, at four o’clock, we’re going to the first line trenches to\\r\\nfind positions for the machine guns. The section leaders are coming, and\\r\\nif you want to come, you’ll find it interesting.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe selection of a machine gun emplacement is essentially a delicate\\r\\ntask. The Germans are past masters in this art. So, in the days of\\r\\nattack when our artillery had made a thorough preparation and they were\\r\\nconvinced that there was nothing left in front and we could advance\\r\\nwithout trouble, exactly as though taking a walk in a square, we found\\r\\nourselves abruptly right in the fire of a Boche machine gun which had not\\r\\nbeen spotted and which was so skilfully camouflaged that it had resisted\\r\\nthe most terrible bombardment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is necessary above all to find a place which commands a wide field of\\r\\nfire and one easy to play on. It must also be easy to conceal the gun\\r\\nin some way, for, if it is once spotted, a shell will soon send the gun\\r\\nand its crew pirouetting in the air, unless they are forewarned by a shot\\r\\ntoo long or too short, but whose destination is unmistakable, and so have\\r\\ntime to move.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was scarcely daylight when we assembled in front of the lieutenant’s\\r\\nquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fog that could be cut with a knife limited our view to a few yards. It\\r\\nwas cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant Lace is there already walking back and forth in the fog. He is\\r\\nalways exactly punctual, anyway. He is equipped as if for an assault with\\r\\nhis revolver, mask, and field glasses. His chest is covered with numerous\\r\\ncolonial decorations, his military medal and his war cross with three\\r\\npalms.\\r\\n\\r\\nLace is a section leader _emeritus_. He is rough and harsh in appearance;\\r\\nhe never smiles, or rarely; he is tanned from his long stay in the\\r\\ncolonies, but he does his duty with unfailing exactness. During an\\r\\nattack in Champagne he found himself under the command of his brother,\\r\\na lieutenant, who was mortally wounded at his side. He embraced him\\r\\nreverently, took the papers, pocketbook and letters from the pockets of\\r\\nhis jacket, removed his decorations, which were now relics, and resumed\\r\\nhis place in the ranks. He fought all day, attacked a fortified position,\\r\\nassisted in the dangerous task of clearing a wood, and when night came,\\r\\nby the light of star shells under a hellish bombardment and a storm of\\r\\nshrapnel, he went back and brought out his brother’s body and gave it\\r\\nproper burial. Lace is a soldier and a conscientious one.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther silhouettes approach and come out of the darkness like ghosts.\\r\\nOne is Poirier, a very young man, who laughs in the midst of the worst\\r\\ndangers, which he absolutely ignores. Then there is big Roullé, whom ten\\r\\nyears in the tropics did not succeed in making thin, and whose breadth of\\r\\nshoulder is ill-adapted to the narrowness of the communication trenches.\\r\\nThen Pierron comes on the run, singing a Neapolitan song. He is from\\r\\nSaigon and is homesick for the Asiatic nights, whose charms he is forever\\r\\ndescribing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the hour strikes the lieutenant appears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe follow the main road through the fog. This leads to Lehons, a ruined\\r\\nvillage which is situated in the lines and cuts the trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne can hardly distinguish the trees in the fields either to the right or\\r\\nthe left. The dawn is silent. Nature wants light for her awakening, but\\r\\nthis morning the lights persist in staying dim.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hear occasionally a cannon shot, as sharp as the crack of a whip. It\\r\\ncomes from a battery of “75’s” concealed in a wood at our side, which\\r\\nfires at stated intervals for tactical reasons. The shell shatters the\\r\\nair over our heads and all becomes quiet again.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we walk along for nearly an hour, some grouped together while others\\r\\ndream away by themselves. The fog now begins to lighten and we are able\\r\\nto see the adjoining fields. They are torn with shell holes, the rare\\r\\ntrees are shattered and slashed, and their branches hang down like broken\\r\\nlimbs. In the ditches, full of muddy water, are piles of material—rolls\\r\\nof barbed wire, eaten by rust, chevaux de frise broken to pieces, and\\r\\ncrossbars and round logs already covered with moss.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, there in front of us, at two paces, splitting the fog is—the\\r\\nvillage. There are houses—remains of houses—and parts of walls which\\r\\nthrough some prodigious feat of balance persist in remaining upright.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first house on the right was apparently of some importance. The two\\r\\nmaster walls still remain in spite of the roof having fallen. Between\\r\\nthem is a pile of stones, burnt girders, and in the middle of the heap of\\r\\nrubbish still stands, intact and rigid, pointing straight toward yawning\\r\\nheaven, the iron balustrade of a winding staircase. A great signboard\\r\\nof black wood runs from one wall to the other, apparently holding them\\r\\ntogether, and one might believe that they only remain upright, thanks\\r\\nto it. It is riddled with bullets and the flames have licked it as they\\r\\npassed, but one can still read the long yellow letters of the inscription:\\r\\n\\r\\n                               _Lodgings_\\r\\n\\r\\n                 _Famous Cuisine_   _Comfortable Rooms_\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of us risk an ironical reflection or a mocking smile, for to-day we\\r\\nhave become accustomed to so many strange inscriptions which in disaster\\r\\nare the living lie of their emptiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpposite, on the other side of the road, the military cemetery shows its\\r\\nmultitude of crosses. Their number has exceeded the capacity of the site\\r\\nprovided for it, and they have already become masters of the surrounding\\r\\nfields. These graves are all immutably alike, and they are built and\\r\\nmaintained with a fraternal affection by companies of Territorials who\\r\\nhold the cantonments in the neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, they are all immutably alike. There is always the white wooden cross\\r\\nwith the name of the deceased, the number of his regiment, his company\\r\\nand the date of his death in simple black letters. The grave is a small\\r\\nsquare, bordered by bits of tile or bricks, sometimes by planks or the\\r\\nbottoms of bottles. And on this humble burial place someone has planted\\r\\nprimroses.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bottle stuck in the ground by the neck holds a bit of paper on which is\\r\\nwritten all supplementary information as to identity which will guide the\\r\\npious pilgrim of to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes a perforated helmet or a tattered cap placed on the cross by\\r\\na comrade who respects his memory tells us that the soldier was wounded\\r\\nin the head. One shudders at some of these helmets, they are rent so\\r\\ngrievously.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe pass rapidly but religiously through the narrow paths between the\\r\\ngraves. It is a sort of duty rather than curiosity which leads us to look\\r\\nover all these cemeteries in search of some known name, a friend’s name,\\r\\nso that we may pay our last respects.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nBut time passes. It would not be prudent to stop longer, for already\\r\\nabove the neighboring hedge we can hear the sinister “ta-co” of the\\r\\nGerman bullets. Branches of an apple tree, lopped off by the shells, fall\\r\\nat our feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we enter the village through what was once a street. Here for fifty\\r\\nyards are barricades of bricks and dirt interlaced with farm instruments\\r\\nand carts.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbed-wire entanglements which only leave a narrow, difficult, zigzag\\r\\npassage between them are evidences of the bitter fights which took place\\r\\nhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reach the church which is the beginning of the communication trench\\r\\nwhich leads to the front lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church! There is absolutely nothing left of it. One might think that\\r\\nthe savagery of the German cannon raged with a special hate on the\\r\\nbuildings created for rest, meditation and prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church has fallen down and the naves are now only a mass of stones\\r\\non which the briers are already beginning to grow. A sort of arched door\\r\\nstill stands at the entrance, without a scratch. It is nearly new and its\\r\\nbrilliant ironwork seems a challenge in the midst of this destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe communication trench starts on the spot where the high altar used\\r\\nto stand. We follow it under the ruins, through the orchards which it\\r\\nfurrows, adjusting our steps to each other, and keeping our eyes on the\\r\\nman ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove our heads nature awakes; the sky appears clear now; and branches of\\r\\ntrees with their buds and blossoms hang over the parapets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is five o’clock and broad daylight when we reach the proposed\\r\\nemplacement. It is on a knoll in the middle of an orchard which is\\r\\nbordered some hundred yards away by hawthorn and privet hedges. Behind\\r\\nthe hedges are the Boche lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineer in charge of laying out the works is on the ground. He tries\\r\\nto profit by the only salient which permits firing on a sufficiently\\r\\nwide sweep of ground. On the right it commands the entrance to the\\r\\nvillage by a road. We see its white windings where it unrolls through the\\r\\ngardens, and then it plunges into a small wood and loses itself. Opposite\\r\\nus the emplacement commands an entire sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will scoop out the place underneath, and they will keep the green\\r\\nshell of grass and bushes which make the most fortunate and natural sort\\r\\nof camouflage. A communication trench grafted on the main trench from the\\r\\nchurch will give access to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrders are given rapidly, measurements are taken, and the tasks laid out.\\r\\nIt is hardly expedient for us to delay in this corner, for our movements\\r\\nwould betray our intentions, and already bullets, which are by no means\\r\\nspent bullets, cross above our heads singing their unappreciated buzz.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe make our way back through the trench.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the village the men belonging to the supporting columns have left\\r\\ntheir lairs and are attending to their usual occupations. Some of them\\r\\nare washing their clothes in the watering-trough in the square and\\r\\nsinging as they wash. The company barber is installed near the fountain\\r\\nand the men form a circle about him as they wait their turn. On a\\r\\nbutcher’s stall of white stone a cook is cutting up a quarter of beef\\r\\ninto equal rations. Only two hundred yards from the enemy the village\\r\\nhas taken up almost its usual existence again. These men are not afraid.\\r\\nAt the sound of the first shell they jump into their cellars, which are\\r\\namply protected by earth and boards. But they already have their customs.\\r\\nShells only come at the hour when the supplies are brought up, and not\\r\\nalways then, for the shelling doesn’t occur regularly every day. The\\r\\nenemy doesn’t waste munitions on a village he knows is so well destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fresh air and the long road have set our teeth on edge and given us\\r\\nan appetite. We halt to break a crust. Some have brought canteens of wine\\r\\nor coffee; bottles of preserves appear, and the improvident—I am one—pay\\r\\nhomage to those who pass a full flask.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun is already high when we start back along the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: A POILU _See page 56_]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant loves a quick pace and a marching song. So at the top of\\r\\nhis lungs he begins one of his lively songs full of expressions that\\r\\nwould have startled a growler of the Empire through their shamelessness,\\r\\nbut which do not disturb the modesty of a Colonial at all, supposing that\\r\\na Colonial ever had any.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the section leaders take up the refrain in chorus.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome steps behind, Sub-Lieutenant Delpos stops to light his fine Egyptian\\r\\ncigarette. In spite of the early hour and the uncertain weather, and\\r\\nwith no thought of the disagreeable march through the sticky mud of the\\r\\ncommunication trench, he is dressed with the greatest care. His bright\\r\\ntan leggings are elegantly curved; his furred gloves are of the finest\\r\\nquality, and the pocket of his jacket, cut in the latest English style,\\r\\nshows a fine cambric handkerchief, subtly scented. And arm in arm we\\r\\nfollow the quick pace of our comrades, while he continues the interrupted\\r\\nstory of his latest exploit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, _mon cher_, picture to yourself an exquisite blonde. I met her on\\r\\nthe Rue des Saints-Pères....”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nOUR FIRST ENGAGEMENT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday evening at five o’clock we received an order to take our\\r\\npositions in the front line to support the attack which the second\\r\\nbattalion would make at nine-thirty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was raining. It has rained all the time for some months, and we have\\r\\nbecome accustomed to the mud and dampness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe left the cantonment at Morcourt at nightfall. We went along the\\r\\ntowpath of the canal, across the bridge at Froissy, through the ruins of\\r\\nÉclusier and entered the communication trench which we knew as the “120\\r\\nlong.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe silent march is accomplished with little difficulty. There is no\\r\\nsound of cannon. Everything is quiet. We reach our positions about\\r\\nmidnight—four dugouts camouflaged for the guns of two sections which are\\r\\nto play on the sector; the two other sections remain in the “Servian”\\r\\ntrench in reserve at the disposal of the commander.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant examines the post established for him. Farther ahead is a\\r\\ncommunication trench which has been completely overturned and destroyed,\\r\\nnow nothing but a great hole. Below is a big tangle of barbed wire,\\r\\nfascines and ripped open sandbags. We can see very well through this\\r\\njumble and we are installed there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can make out the details of the Boche lines through the glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come. I think it will be all right. But it will be hard. Fortunately, it\\r\\ncan’t last long.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we return to the positions for a final inspection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emplacements which our guns occupy are round excavations about\\r\\nthree yards across and two deep. In the middle nearly on a level with\\r\\nthe surrounding ground is a sort of pedestal for the machine gun. The\\r\\nbarrel scarcely reaches beyond the hole and it is absolutely invisible\\r\\nat a short distance. The men have proceeded to make a camouflage which\\r\\nresembles the character of the terrain with wickerwork covered by dirt\\r\\nand grass. The many inventions with which they have increased the weight\\r\\nof the machine guns—the shield, sights and periscope—are in their\\r\\nplaces. The men disdain these additions a little and even neglect to use\\r\\nthem unless forced to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They would only have to add a little more,” they say, “to make a ‘75’\\r\\ninstead of a machine gun.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The periscope may be of use for something. You have to try half an hour\\r\\nbefore you can see anything. I like my eyes better.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ammunition wagons are installed and opened; the belts are ready; the\\r\\ngun layer, the loader, and the crew are at their stations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant makes the rounds of each section, inspecting the guns,\\r\\ntesting the mechanism, trying the weight of the munitions, taking account\\r\\nof everything and looking each man in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are the last company organized,” he says. “You know that the machine\\r\\ngunners should be the flower of the army; don’t forget it. It is our\\r\\nfirst engagement. Try to show that we’re there a little.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis short unpretentious harangue produces its effect on the men, who\\r\\nsmile as they listen to it. They are not nervous now, but only slightly\\r\\ncurious. They are not sorry to put their toys to the test at last, and\\r\\nto shoot their projectiles at something besides the moving figures in the\\r\\ntraining camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the inspection is over and the final instructions have been given,\\r\\nwe return to the commandant’s station, and stretch out to sleep on the\\r\\nreserve caissons which protect us from the mud. Rifts in the clouds\\r\\nreveal the stars. It will be fine to-morrow. But waiting is cold, very\\r\\ncold, and it is impossible to sleep under such a wind. We talk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re going to hear a concert. They haven’t massed more than three\\r\\nhundred guns in all, from the ‘75’ to the heavy artillery, on our fifteen\\r\\nhundred yard front for nothing. Have you seen the ‘150’ mortars? They\\r\\nhave some muzzles.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDawn appears. A light fog rises from the ground and seems thickest at the\\r\\nside of the canal where the German positions are. It is the coldest hour\\r\\nof the day and the earth of our dugout is as hard as iron; it is frozen.\\r\\nInstinctively I let down the ear-flaps of my cap which until now I have\\r\\nkept under my helmet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you cold?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not warm.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A drop of brandy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sure.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant passes his canteen to me and as I drink the thin stream\\r\\nfrom its mouth I feel a wave of warmth.\\r\\n\\r\\nLight comes, but it is very pale. Around us we hear the tread of feet on\\r\\nthe hard ground and the slapping of arms across the chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe wait nervously. Presently we receive an order not to fire until the\\r\\nblast of the whistle.\\r\\n\\r\\nEight o’clock! Behind us, in the limpid azure, the red disk of the sun\\r\\nrises.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shell cuts through the air; then another; then still another. Our\\r\\nartillery is firing on the Boche lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Attention.” The response is instantaneous. We can still see no movement\\r\\nin the ranks of the infantry to our right whose rush we are to support.\\r\\nWhat are they waiting for? The men are nervous and they start to grumble.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoom! comes the Boche’s reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great mass of earth, grass and crumbled stones shoots up a hundred\\r\\nyards ahead of us!\\r\\n\\r\\nToo short!\\r\\n\\r\\nBoom! still another. Still short!\\r\\n\\r\\nA large shell heads for us. It thunders. Where is it going to burst? The\\r\\ndevil! It falls near our first section, to the left; then, almost at\\r\\nonce, another, a little to the right. Are we spotted? We haven’t fired a\\r\\ncartridge yet, and there isn’t an aeroplane or sausage in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo “150’s,” one right after the other, burst fair on the section, right\\r\\nin the hole. An enormous mass of earth spurts up. Through the dust and\\r\\nsmoke we see broken arms, sandbags ripped open, legs torn from the body,\\r\\nan entire body, the gun!...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant knits his brows in dismay. A sergeant from the reserve\\r\\nhalf section, slightly pale, runs up with the details.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sergeant Rollé, the gun layer, and the crew are killed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Occupy the emplacement with your half-section.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well, Lieutenant.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShells are falling in our sector without a break. All the guns are\\r\\nsplattered with splinters and most of the crews are slightly wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nDurozier’s half section jump out of their dugout in a hurry and throw\\r\\nthemselves into the hole which has now increased in size to a vast\\r\\nyawning crater.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If we could only fire on something. But there’s nothing to see. And no\\r\\nsignal.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boche artillery certainly has a grudge against our first section.\\r\\nThe new gun is scarcely in position when a great shell falls in the same\\r\\nplace, in the same crater.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see distinctly a body blown high into the air, and the body still\\r\\nholds the mount of the machine gun which he was just setting in place.\\r\\nHeadless, disemboweled, it falls just in front of our dugout within reach\\r\\nof our hands. It is Gouzé, the chief gunner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The _salauds_!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAn intelligence officer from the major reaches us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get ready to support the wave which is going over with all your guns!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shells burst on our position implacably. There isn’t the slightest\\r\\nchoice between the emplacements. Three guns are still intact and ready\\r\\nto fire at the blast of the whistle. But the fourth gun must be put in\\r\\nposition, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell the adjutant of the section to occupy the crater,” comes the order.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy means of the half-destroyed communication trench I reach the section\\r\\nwhich I find burrowing in shelters built hastily out of whatever came\\r\\nhandiest and deliver my order.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adjutant takes it and turns pale.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, but there’s no great chance of our getting there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir hearts throb, and they look at each other. It is true that it is\\r\\nnecessary, but on the parapet between the trench and the crater, no\\r\\nlonger the slightest protection, shells fall like hail and without a\\r\\nlet-up. They hesitate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if he had foreseen this, the lieutenant had followed behind me. He\\r\\nreads their hesitation in their faces and is about to say something to\\r\\novercome it when the blast of the major’s whistle sounds. It is the\\r\\nsignal. The wave jumps from the parallels and dashes forward. We must\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur three guns have already begun their rattle and are spraying the\\r\\nterrain before the enemy’s trenches close to the ground, probing the\\r\\nloopholes, mowing the parapets, and cutting the last of the barbed wire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth gun ought to fire too; it must. Then, quietly, with that\\r\\nunusual coolness which characterizes him, the lieutenant clambers over\\r\\nthe parapet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you come with me, _Margis_?”\\r\\n\\r\\nCigarette between his lips, leaning carelessly on his curved handled\\r\\ncane, as though he were going for a morning walk through the fields, he\\r\\nadvances, standing very straight, without hurrying, and without losing an\\r\\ninch of his great height.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men understand. Five seconds later we are in the crater and in less\\r\\ntime than it takes to tell it the gun begins to fire like the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy’s artillery has now changed its objective. It now aims its fire\\r\\non the assaulting wave.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe return to our shelter. The spectacle is wonderful. Almost without\\r\\nlosses, our waves reach the first of the enemy’s lines and clear them at\\r\\na bound.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lengthen the fire.... On the second position.... Farther ... on the\\r\\nthird; on the fortified emplacement; to the left of the woods.... Fire,\\r\\nfire, fire, nom de Dieu!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire on our sector begins again more violently than ever. We have\\r\\nbothered the enemy and he wants to silence us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree out of four of our guns are silent. The fourth, the last one to\\r\\narrive, with all the rapidity of its fire, alone sustains the attack of\\r\\nour infantry. The wonderful little machine devours without a skip the\\r\\nendless munitions which the crew have difficulty in bringing to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fire, Adjutant, fire! Don’t stop. Give it to them,” shouts the\\r\\nlieutenant, seized by the fever of battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the adjutant fires, fires without stopping. Our wave reaches its\\r\\nobjective, the enemy flees, whole companies surrender.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s it; we are there. Fire on the reserves, farther, the length of\\r\\nthe embankment. Cease firing, stop it, stop firing. We are there....\\r\\nCease firing!”\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as he shouts this order a shell, the last one—the third on the same\\r\\nspot—falls, bursts, and buries the gun and its heroic crew.\\r\\n\\r\\n“M ...! The swine! Can’t they see that it is finished?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHeavily and mournfully we make toll of the dead. Comrades pay their last\\r\\nrespects to their comrades. They take their letters and keepsakes, and\\r\\narrange the bodies for their last resting place as best they can.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe order to go back is given.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two hours we make our way through the communication trench, now only\\r\\na stream of mud in which we sink to our ankles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe advance, dejected, silent, heavy with fatigue, depressed by the\\r\\nthought of those we have left behind, whom we shall never see again, as\\r\\nwas our wont, even yesterday at the cantonment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant is in the lead, leaning on his baton, silently, chewing on\\r\\nhis eternal cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe finally reach the end of the trench at Froissy and come out on the\\r\\nmain road.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of their long hours of fatigue and the sleepless nights, the men\\r\\nsuddenly seem less weary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey no longer march one on top of the other, stepping over corpses.\\r\\nTheir horizon has broadened; they see; they breathe; they come out of\\r\\ntheir trance; they emerge from Hell, they come from death. They are\\r\\ncoming back to life!\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo hundred yards ahead we can already see groups: our mules, our\\r\\nlimbers, companies of Territorials who are repairing the roads, sappers\\r\\nfrom the engineer corps, men from the field kitchens, automobiles, dreams\\r\\n... the living world at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sub-lieutenant has remained at the rear of the column, assuming the\\r\\ndifficult task of encouraging the stragglers and keeping up the spirits\\r\\nof the weak. Now he runs up and down the ranks. He is proud of his men;\\r\\nhe loves their swagger and steadiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, children, a little speed. Try to march by these people in some\\r\\nstyle.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as we approach the first huts he begins to sing at the top of his\\r\\nlungs his song, the song of the machine gun:\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Mais dans le petit jour blémi,_\\r\\n    _Alerte! Voici l’ennemi!_\\r\\n    _Et t’éveillant soudain rageuse,_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse,_\\r\\n    _Avec tes tac tac réguliers,_\\r\\n    _Sans t’arrêter, noire et fumeuse,_\\r\\n          _Ma mitrailleuse._\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the men look at him in surprise, look at him and then begin to\\r\\nsing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this bruised troop, which had just lost half its effective strength,\\r\\nwith its wounded men with their bloody bandages, their torn clothes,\\r\\ntheir arms in bits, filed by singing this heroic joyful song, expressing\\r\\nin their voices all their hopes and all their triumphs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt defiled between lines of astonished men who stood respectful,\\r\\nstupefied at so much energy, so much fire and dash in the face of so much\\r\\ndeath.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn position before his staff, fingers together in the prescribed position\\r\\nof salute, a general stood with bared head, while the company marched by.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nEASTER EGGS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEaster—it fell on April twenty-third that year—dawned splendidly, a real\\r\\nday of gladsome spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company was off duty. We had worked for a month on the fortifications\\r\\nin the front-line trenches and we deserved this fine day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition the sector was quiet. There hadn’t been an engagement or a\\r\\nskirmish since February. This large village—more than a village, a town\\r\\nalmost—scarcely five miles from the Boche lines, absolutely unprotected,\\r\\nnot concealed in the slightest by a bend in the terrain, by a hill or a\\r\\nwood, had not received a single shell in three months.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course it is true that the church, town hall and some factories were\\r\\ninjured, but not very much. They had some large shell holes, but they\\r\\nhadn’t fallen in or tumbled down. The church and town hall still had\\r\\ntheir roofs, and if the chimneys of the sugar refineries were cut on the\\r\\nbias, it was high up, almost at the top, as if they wanted to blunt them,\\r\\nor spare them, or preserve them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were now accustomed to this incomprehensible calm, in fact the\\r\\nofficers were often heard to say,\\r\\n\\r\\n“This quiet bodes no good to us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day and nearly all night, too, we hear the shriek of French and Boche\\r\\nshells in the air. Batteries of heavy artillery search for their marks,\\r\\nbut all that misses us and passes over our heads or strikes in front. We\\r\\nknow that they aren’t aimed at us, and we take no interest in them. So\\r\\nwith that fine carelessness of men long since accustomed to the worst\\r\\ndangers, we live in absolute security.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Easter morning a musical mass was sung in an immense great hall\\r\\nwhich had been used formerly for entertainments. A crowd of soldiers\\r\\nof every branch of the service and from all the regiments encamped in\\r\\nthe neighborhood packed the place. In the crowd was a goodly number of\\r\\ncivilians, including women and girls who were wearing their best dresses\\r\\nfor the first time in a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band of the ... first Territorials played.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone beside me dared to murmur,\\r\\n\\r\\n“All the same, if a Boche shell fell in that crowd, what a mess it would\\r\\nbe!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t think,” came from several sides at once, “about Boche shells. They\\r\\nfire them. They know we are here. They are afraid—”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chaplain, assisted by two clerical stretcher bearers, began worship\\r\\non the improvised altar on the stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoldiers sang the psalms of the liturgy.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nI was nervous, and sobs came to my throat. In order not to make a\\r\\nridiculous spectacle of myself with my tears I went out. I ran to the\\r\\ncantonment, saddled my horse, and we galloped at random through the\\r\\nsunny country on paths covered with flowers. I stopped in the depths of\\r\\na valley under the poplars and stretched out on the grass. My horse laid\\r\\ndown beside me. And while he munched the grass entirely indifferent to\\r\\nme, I said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kiki, old Kiki, if an unexpected shell fell on us now and blotted us\\r\\nout, that would be much less disastrous than if it fell among those who\\r\\nat this hour are praying in that chapel. They are praying for their\\r\\nfaraway firesides, their mothers, their wives.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are praying for the preservation of the past and for the future.\\r\\nThey have the joy of believing, and that belief, that faith, has steeped\\r\\nthem in a special life to which they remain attached.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But we, old horse? If a shell annihilates us, what of it?\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have never believed anything and we never will.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have impressed my brutal scepticism on the beings who are nearest and\\r\\ndearest to me. I have torn down the faith of their cradles ... a faith in\\r\\nthe Beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So when we shall be under the sod sleeping our long night, before next\\r\\nspring has awakened its green verdure on our remains, base and nameless\\r\\noblivion will already have overtaken us. On the simple white cross my\\r\\nhastily traced name will not even be read....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps in passing near my abandoned grave someone will say, ‘Poor\\r\\nfellow!’ Perhaps someone more sentimental than the rest will throw\\r\\nflowers on it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But in disappearing, old horse, we shall harm no one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The tears on the beautiful eyes I know so well will at first be bitter,\\r\\nbut they will be dried at last.”\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rather melancholy monologue was not to Kiki’s taste at all. He\\r\\ninterrupted me by whinnying loudly. He knew it was time for oats.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we went back to the cantonment under the fine midday sun. Before our\\r\\ndoor at the last house on the left, on the road to the sugar refinery,\\r\\nBurette, the quartermaster-sergeant, was going through his matutinal\\r\\nablutions. He generally began them about eleven, just as they were\\r\\ncalling dinner, which made him twenty minutes late and gave him a chance\\r\\nto growl about the cooking, which was not hot enough to suit him, or\\r\\nabout his share, which, according to his appetite, was reduced to a\\r\\nproper allowance.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside, seated before an open canteen which served him equally as a seat\\r\\nor a writing desk, was Adjutant Dotan reading and re-reading and sighing\\r\\nover the letters he took from a voluminous package in front of him. In a\\r\\nloud voice he mused over the problem which haunted his days and nights:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall I marry? Or, shall I not?”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two years now Dotan had seen the realization of his matrimonial\\r\\nprojects grow further and further away from week to week, from month to\\r\\nmonth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first leave the Regimental Administrative Council had not acted on\\r\\nhis request. Then, for two consecutive times, leave was stopped on the\\r\\nday before he was going to go. And despite the advice of the colonel, to\\r\\nwhom he told his grievance, Dotan would not marry by proxy. This ceremony\\r\\n_in partibus_, entrusted to a third party, seemed to him the least bit\\r\\nridiculous, and he had a well-developed desire for the whole of the\\r\\nwedding ceremonies.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall I marry? Or, shall I not?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he thought over his dilemma, he read for the hundredth time the\\r\\nletters from his gentle fiancée, who awaited him in Provence. And he\\r\\noccupied the monotony of the long hours in writing her two letters a\\r\\nday, one in the morning and another in the evening, with sometimes a\\r\\nsupplementary postal card in addition.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To think that if I were married I should have already been so happy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Three days,” Morin let fall cynically in his innocent voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I should have been happy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Three days,” insisted Morin, “the second day before, the day before, and\\r\\nthe day of your wedding until noon. And then you wouldn’t be as you are\\r\\nnow—free, tranquil, and without a care.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Free, tranquil, without a care! Oh, yes, you say. You’re always the\\r\\nsame. Free, tranquil and happy! You must have learned that by looking out\\r\\nof your window, you, say....”\\r\\n\\r\\nMorin, in accordance with his parsimonious use of words, did not want to\\r\\ncarry on this tedious discussion. He would have answered, nevertheless,\\r\\nhad not Dedouche announced that the table was set, and that there was a\\r\\nwonderful menu, a real Easter menu.\\r\\n\\r\\nChevalier, the mess corporal, both our Vatel and cup bearer, had come\\r\\nback from leave the day before. Before our ravished eyes he untied his\\r\\npackages, spread out sumptuous, epicurean dainties, and drew from their\\r\\nthick straw covers generous bottles of wine whose very appearance made\\r\\nus joyful.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorin had been a constant guest at the select restaurants of La\\r\\nCannebière and at the famous inns of La Corniche, and is an expert in the\\r\\nart of opening a fine wine without shaking it, and he also knows how to\\r\\ncarve roasts and chickens skilfully and symmetrically.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was opening with suitable impressiveness an old bottle of Sauterne,\\r\\nwhose bright golden color brought smiles to our faces, when a tremendous\\r\\nexplosion brought us to our feet and threw down the single partition in\\r\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The gun back in the garden draws the fire,” mumbled Dedouche with his\\r\\nmouth full, and without letting go of his plate which he was rubbing\\r\\ncarefully with a large bit of bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as he spoke a still more violent explosion shattered all the window\\r\\npanes in the house to bits.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great Boche shell had fallen thirty yards from us in the street which\\r\\nhad been recently covered with hard flint and which it scattered into\\r\\ninnumerable fragments. We heard the cries of the wounded and the dying\\r\\noutside.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quick! Into the cellar!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut none of us lost our heads sufficiently to take refuge in the cellar\\r\\nwithout our munitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne brought the fowl, another the bottles, a third the sauce, and someone\\r\\nthe cheese and candles, and under the threat of shots which speeded us we\\r\\nreached our underground shelter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe light of two candles stuck in bottles showed us the table in the\\r\\ndarkness and we spread out our dinner things anew.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove was the bombardment in all its intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\nShots landed in the road level with our air-hole, which, as a provision\\r\\nagainst such an occurrence, had long since been stuffed with sandbags.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe heard things falling!\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Mince!_ what are they offering us for Easter eggs?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ready joke made us laugh, and we forgot the tragedy of the hour. In\\r\\nthe heady anesthesia of real Pommard, and not christened “Pommard” for\\r\\nuse at the front, but which had a real Burgundian bouquet, we forgot that\\r\\nthe shells were raging in all their fury above us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shadow of a man appeared at the entrance to the cellar. Illuminated\\r\\nby the wavering yellow lights of our candles, it stood out in sharp\\r\\ncontrast in the darkness of the staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is the margis here?... Margis, the lieutenant says you are to bring all\\r\\nthe horses at once to the gulley in the Caix woods and shelter them from\\r\\nthe bombardment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, I’m coming. Go on, Dedouche, pour out another glass of\\r\\nPommard. I’ll take my dessert in my pocket.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI picked up my helmet, mask and cane and was ready to go, as I listened\\r\\nthrough the vaults and hoped for a let-up in the storm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s over. We can go.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When you wish, old fellow. They’ve stopped for breath.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll find out in five minutes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bah! I’ve more time to go than I need.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good luck, and if you find any Easter eggs on the way bring them back\\r\\nfor dinner.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adjutant’s reiterated joke no longer had the same zest for me and it\\r\\nhardly made me smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside, the streets were empty, and there wasn’t a soul in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bombardment had stopped, but no one was taken in by this deceptive\\r\\ncalm. From one moment to another we waited for a new bombardment even\\r\\nmore violent than the first. The Boches are creatures of habit and this\\r\\nis not the first time they’ve played this trick. When they bombard a\\r\\ncantonment, they very often interrupt their bombardment some minutes so\\r\\nas to make us think it is over; then, when the men have ventured into the\\r\\nstreets, they suddenly begin again and make fresh victims.\\r\\n\\r\\nA house has fallen in the middle of the road some steps from our\\r\\ncantonment. Débris block the way, and we have to climb over them. Farther\\r\\nalong, at the other end of the street, a house which was still intact\\r\\nthis morning is now in flames.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no time to lose. Already several shells, advance messengers of\\r\\nthe coming storm, begin to fall. I was about to dart across the Place\\r\\nwhen a “105” fell on the pavements and burst.\\r\\n\\r\\nA poor little soldier carrying two enormous bags, a great bundle of\\r\\nlinen, and some souvenirs in his hands passed just then. He was on his\\r\\nway to the station at Guillaucourt to take the train, for he was going on\\r\\nleave.\\r\\n\\r\\nRejoicing in his approaching happiness he walked on without paying the\\r\\nslightest attention to this atmosphere where death was hovering. A shot\\r\\nhit him in the back and passed out the other side. I jumped to aid him.\\r\\nHe was bathed in blood. In a gentle, caressing, almost timid voice he\\r\\nsaid to me:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it’s not painful. I am dying.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then with his lips, with an expression of kindness and thankfulness\\r\\nwhich I shall never forget, he murmured, “Yvonne.” ... And his face\\r\\nhaloed with blessedness like the religious images of the martyrs, he died.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stood there in ecstasy, transfixed, before that beauty in death, before\\r\\nthat strength of love which lights the final hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many I have seen die in this way! In their last breaths all had the\\r\\nname of some woman, and their eyes lighted at the name.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the final moment of a life which is going out physical suffering no\\r\\nlonger counts. The name of the loved one embodies all the vanishing\\r\\nmirage of the future, the end of a too beautiful dream, the memories of\\r\\na happy past ... of a happy past, for the bad times are forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the quivering body of this poor little soldier, struck down\\r\\nfiercely just as he was going on leave, full of hope, of plans, of\\r\\ndreams, a song on his lips, I forgot the threatening shells. An\\r\\nartilleryman went by on the run and shouted at me:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get out of that. You’ll get done up.” And I fled.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nOur horses were bivouacked in the courtyard of a sawmill. Not an accident\\r\\nthere. I counted them all at a glance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe underground shelter of the men was in the back of the yard, and I\\r\\nwent to the air-hole which was stopped up by a piece of sheet-iron which\\r\\nserved as a screen against splinters.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, down there! Men of the echelon. All outside. To horse. We must\\r\\nhurry. Come on, hurry up! Your masks, helmets, forward with just the\\r\\nbridle!”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne by one they jumped out of their lairs, grimacing as the bright sun\\r\\nstruck them full in the face as they came out of the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Each one two horses, by squads of six.... One hundred yards between each\\r\\nsquad. The other men will remain here and mobilize the pack saddles and\\r\\ncaissons in the cellar. Take the road to the Caix station ... on the road\\r\\nlined with poplars.... On the gallop ... no straggling.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSome minutes later we were already going out of the village. It was a bad\\r\\npassage, but the only one and the shortest one to reach our destination,\\r\\nbut three hundred yards had to be covered on entirely unprotected ground\\r\\nopposite the Boches.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoom! It was the expected. The shells began to fall again. A cloud tinted\\r\\nwith red from the tiles of a falling house rises in the air and makes a\\r\\nlarge spot in the sky back by the church.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoom! There’s another one now and nearer to us, near the sugar refinery.\\r\\n\\r\\nA crash, an avalanche of bricks; this time it is the chimney of the\\r\\nsawmill which falls on the horses’ cantonment. It was time, five minutes\\r\\nsooner and we would have been under it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go on, go on.... Gallop, for God’s sake. Corporals ... keep the\\r\\ndistances.... Spread out the squads.... Get into the fields ... behind\\r\\nthe trees.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reach the deep path like a whirlwind, while the bombardment rages over\\r\\nthe village more than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Any accident? Anyone hit? Good. Assemble, and on the trot now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTen minutes later we are in the shelter of Muguet wood, completely shut\\r\\noff from the view of the Boche artillery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wood deserves its name, for it scents the air a hundred yards about\\r\\nwith the perfume of violets and lilies of the valley, which form a carpet\\r\\nbetween the trees and which our mules, entirely insensible to the subtle\\r\\nbeauties of nature, begin to eat as though they were common fodder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Corporals ... look to your sections.... Is everyone here?... All the\\r\\nhorses too?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI cast a rapid glance over the parked beasts.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look, Liniers, where is Chocolate?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd indeed where was Chocolate?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow did it happen that Chocolate wasn’t there?\\r\\n\\r\\nStill he had been with the rest at the sawmill.\\r\\n\\r\\nChocolate, as the veteran of the echelon, received special consideration\\r\\nfrom the men. As far as the dispositions of the cantonment permitted,\\r\\nthey reserved for him a covered shelter, a feeding rack, and a manger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time the sawmill offered many resources. The stable walls still\\r\\nstood with only a few gaps, and the roof was still intact. Beside some\\r\\nartillery horses, who were generally absent, there was an available place\\r\\nand they had given it to Chocolate. And there the drivers had forgotten\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it had been any other animal we would have let him go, but Chocolate\\r\\nwas an entirely different matter and we must go and find him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Raynal, I hand over the command of the detachment to you. Liniers, come\\r\\nwith me, we’ll go and find Chocolate.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went back over the path, on foot this time, but as fast as our legs\\r\\nwould go. As we reached the village the intensity of the bombardment\\r\\nseemed to decrease. Were we going to be lucky enough to strike another\\r\\nlull? Again there were particularly violent explosions, nearer, then\\r\\nnothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reached the village entirely out of breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we turned into the street which led to the sawmill Liniers stopped\\r\\nsuddenly, as if petrified, and began to wave his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“M ...!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The shed....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what about the shed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Demolished. Can’t you see? It’s gone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ran still faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shed was absolutely demolished and is now only a shapeless mass of\\r\\nrubbish, but there are no signs of a shell—no traces of burned timbers,\\r\\nno splinters. One would have thought that it had folded up and laid down\\r\\non its side like a house of cards.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we reached the shed we saw Chocolate’s great neck and shoulders and\\r\\nenormous head free from the rubbish which hid the rest of his body. He\\r\\nwas stretched out full length on his side, browsing serenely on the young\\r\\nshoots of an apple tree, which had gone down with the building. His large\\r\\neye looked us over as we stood there, overcome and absolutely stupefied\\r\\nwith amazement, as much as to say:\\r\\n\\r\\n“What ... you’ve come at last ... you needn’t have been in so much of a\\r\\nhurry.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran to the air-hole of the cellar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey there, men with spades; quick, come, dig out Chocolate.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dig out Chocolate!” and they all rushed out utterly surprised by the\\r\\nannouncement of such a job.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bricks were scattered with a few blows of the shovels, the beams\\r\\nraised, and the place cleared away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all the ease of a circus horse who has been playing dead, Chocolate\\r\\nstretched out his front feet, then his hind ones, balanced himself two\\r\\nor three times, took a spring, and without the slightest hurry stood up,\\r\\nshaking himself all over like a dog coming out of the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a few scratches on his hide, but it was an old hide, hard\\r\\nand tanned, which resists everything. Nothing broken! Brave Chocolate,\\r\\ncome on! The men all look at him, admire him, and fondle him. He seemed\\r\\nsomewhat surprised by such manifestations of great affection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd without a care in the world for the bombardment which was beginning\\r\\nagain, he went to the nearby pond and drank deeply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE AEROPLANE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDawn had just broken. Some of the boldest of the men in the echelon were\\r\\nalready up, rubbing down their horses and adjusting the breast collars.\\r\\nAt daylight we had to go a long way to exchange the pack-saddles for\\r\\nmunition-wagons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has been the way from the start. The companies of machine guns,\\r\\nprobably even more than the other branches of service, although I don’t\\r\\nknow, are experiment stations on which they try one sort of gear one day\\r\\nand another the next. First it is a round shield, then a square shield,\\r\\nand then a periscope. We adopted the Wikers saddle, only to have it\\r\\nreplaced with the Hotchkiss. And we had scarcely put it in service than\\r\\nit was withdrawn to give us ammunition wagons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese changes are one of the slight distractions of the trade. They must\\r\\ndistract still more the handlers of the public funds to judge by the\\r\\nfrequency they offer them to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what difference does it make to us whether we do one thing or\\r\\nanother? While we wait time passes and the war goes on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then “there’s no use trying to understand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is the typical expression in every army. Before the most unexpected\\r\\norders, the most unusual, which seem the most useless and incoherent, we\\r\\ncan only bow without trying to use our intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no use in trying to understand.” That’s the whole secret of\\r\\ndiscipline. If one did try to understand, he would never obey—or too late.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were ordered to assemble on the Place at daybreak, and at daybreak we\\r\\nwere there. The clear sky is splendidly luminous.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good weather for aeroplanes,” said someone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed it was good weather for aeroplanes, for there wasn’t a cloud in\\r\\nthe sky and no mist on the ground. A reconnaissance in such weather\\r\\nshould be easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boche aviators are early birds. One sees them but rarely during the\\r\\ndaytime, when ours mount guard on the lines, but their specialty is\\r\\ngetting up early in the morning. We hear them flying over our cantonments\\r\\nlong before daybreak, at the first rays of dawn, and see them returning\\r\\nrapidly to shelter as soon as the light becomes clearer and it becomes\\r\\neasier to fire our cannon and machine guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently, as I am giving a final inspection to the material we are to\\r\\nturn in, I meet Sergeant Lace in the yard of the sawmill.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, but you’re an early bird to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve just been ordered to find a good place to fire on aeroplanes and\\r\\ntake up my position there at once. There’s going to be a section there\\r\\neach day. Mine starts.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you found your emplacement?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not yet. But that’s not hard to find. Just a hole or a sloping place, so\\r\\nthat we can stretch out on our backs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know just the place for you. The hole of a ‘320’ at the entrance of\\r\\nthe village on the left, near the poplars. You’ll see it right up against\\r\\nthe fence which borders the road from Caix.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wonderful. I’ll take up my position there. It must have been dug\\r\\nexpressly for me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA half hour later the cavalry of the three machine-gun companies of the\\r\\nregiment assembled in front of the church.\\r\\n\\r\\nCavalry!...\\r\\n\\r\\nMy good comrade, Roudon, a sergeant-major in the Hussars, who is now\\r\\nwith the first company of machine guns in a position like mine, becomes\\r\\nfuriously angry every time he hears that word “cavalry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cavalry! Cavalry!” he roars. “You ought to say an assery, a mulery. Just\\r\\nlook at them. Not one in ten stands up on his feet. And the riders! There\\r\\nisn’t one who could ride a horse. They’re afraid!”\\r\\n\\r\\nRoudon is an experienced cavalryman. For ten years he knew the mad,\\r\\nintoxicating dashes with the Algerian contingents in Morocco, the\\r\\nmysterious attractions of reconnaissances in the long reaches of the\\r\\nvalleys of the Sahara, impetuous charges and wild triumphant pursuits\\r\\namong the red Spahis with their Damascus swords, amid the glistening\\r\\nsands which rise toward the sun in golden spangles. At the beginning of\\r\\nthe war he was thrown into a regiment of metropolitan cavalry and fought\\r\\nin Lorraine and Belgium. He lived through the horrible hours of retreat,\\r\\nassuming the perilous mission of rearguard while the other regiments\\r\\nwithdrew in good order. He fought on foot, in the edges of woods, to stop\\r\\nto the last moment the march of the enemy while the rear went on to the\\r\\nMarne. He endured those long, seemingly endless, waits on foot in front\\r\\nof his horse, the bridle on his arm, saber in scabbard, under the storm\\r\\nof shells and the invisible menace of bullets. There were no trenches\\r\\nthen.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoudon is a cavalryman in his soul and his love for the service. So,\\r\\nattached to an improvised service which is neither cavalry, artillery,\\r\\nnor infantry, he does not know what to make of it, and he rages at it\\r\\nthrough his excess of conscience and too exclusive love of duty perfectly\\r\\ndone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe echelon of the third company arrives on the Place in good order a\\r\\nfew seconds after us. Hémin leads it and he marches on foot beside his\\r\\ncolumn, hands in his pockets, whistling.\\r\\n\\r\\nHémin is a type, and not the least interesting among the complex\\r\\npersonalities of our command, for we are cavalrymen transformed into\\r\\ninfantry, but we’re still cavalrymen just the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nHémin is as much a cavalryman by trade as Roudon, and perhaps even more\\r\\nso. He was successively a stable boy in a racing stable at Chantilly,\\r\\nthen a jockey, and finally a trainer, after he had done his military\\r\\nservice in a regiment of chasseurs. So he is a horseman par excellence.\\r\\nBut he never made war as a cavalryman before. Since the beginning of the\\r\\nwar he has been attached to various services. First, he was an infantry\\r\\nscout, a standard bearer for a general, a courier for a major, and he was\\r\\ntransferred to the companies of machine guns when they were definitely\\r\\nestablished. Hémin has a style all his own. To all appearances he is\\r\\nneither a cavalryman nor a foot soldier. His jacket is a Colonial one\\r\\nwith anchors and cuff-facings, but it has white stripes. He wears great\\r\\nyellow boots, a cavalryman’s spurs, his breeches are reinforced with\\r\\nolive leather, and his head is covered with a very small black cap.\\r\\nAnother curious characteristic is that Hémin, the excellent horseman,\\r\\nalways walks when he accompanies his detachment.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we are assembled, we turn the command of the detachment over to\\r\\nRoudon, the senior officer, and he leads the way. Hémin and I bring up\\r\\nthe rear some distance back.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn files of two our one hundred and fifty horses and mules form a long\\r\\ncolumn, unwieldy and slow, which winds along the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fine target for an aeroplane!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis exclamation had hardly been uttered when the well-known roar of a\\r\\nBoche aeroplane was heard over our heads.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Zut! there’s one.... We ought to have expected it in such weather and\\r\\nstarted earlier. Look out, if he spots us. Don’t worry, there’s no\\r\\ndanger, he’s too high.... At least three thousand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA “75” was already weaving around this scarcely visible, extremely mobile\\r\\ntarget the white tufts of its shrapnel, and threw around the machine a\\r\\nmurderous circle which followed it in its evolutions. But the aeroplane\\r\\nin the air seemed to care little and it continued on its way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all followed the vicissitudes of the fight as we went along, heads in\\r\\nthe air. When a shell seemed to burst very near, an exclamation came from\\r\\nevery mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh!... that didn’t miss much.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A little more to the left; that would get him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that missed.... He’s too far.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is outrageous ... he’s gone ... he’s getting away.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as a matter of fact the aeroplane gets away ... outside the “75’s”\\r\\nfield of fire. It guides itself no doubt by the white ribbon of the road\\r\\nwhich shows clearly against the rich green of the pastures.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has seen us now. He has seen us crawling, winding and unrolling on the\\r\\nribbon. He heads straight for us, circling around in circles of which we\\r\\nare without a doubt the center, and gradually comes lower.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look out for the bombs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No ... he’s half turned ... he’s going back.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Going back.... You’ll see.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe’s lower now and we can see distinctly the great black crosses under\\r\\nhis wings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll our men are looking. The horses seem to scent the danger, for they\\r\\nprick up their ears and paw the ground, while the mules neigh.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly from on high something begins to glide along some aerial rail\\r\\nand shatters the air above us. That lasts a second, a flash. As we listen\\r\\nand wait one would have said that it falls slowly and for hours. We look\\r\\nin the direction of the noise as if to see something, as if to see where\\r\\nthe bombardment is going to fall. It seems like a linked chain which\\r\\nrolls out, clashing its links against each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tremendous boom, and black smoke, greenish and red as well, blacker,\\r\\ndenser, thicker than that from the great shells, rises in the middle of\\r\\nthe field a hundred and fifty yards on our right.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there is another. It bursts on our left at the same distance. He is\\r\\ncertainly searching for the range. Will the next strike in the middle\\r\\nand right on the mark? We’re a fine mark, to be sure, a fine target,—one\\r\\nhundred and fifty horses in Indian file. If he doesn’t make a good shot\\r\\nhe’s a duffer.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoudon stands up in his stirrups, turns around, and shouts commands to\\r\\nthe uneasy men:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Close up, close up, close up, I say.... Dress up together.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe leads the column rapidly, now closed up into a compact group like a\\r\\nflock of sheep, towards the road from Harbonnières, which is lined with\\r\\ntrees that will conceal us from the aeroplane.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo other bombs burst behind us one after another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That makes four. He can’t have many left. He didn’t bring a truck!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSome hundred yards away near a pond cows graze absolutely indifferent\\r\\nto the battle in the air. The “75” again begins to fire. Its bursts of\\r\\nshrapnel come close to the aeroplane but do not hit it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother bomb. I stop. It looks as though it were going to fall in front\\r\\nof us. I’m not going to put my head under the knife. So I start to draw\\r\\nmy horse back under the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere it is. It has fallen in the fields again. But its explosion throws\\r\\nup dismal fragments, large and bloody ones. It fell squarely on the herd\\r\\nof cows and annihilated it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The bungler! He’s wasting the milk,” comes in the accent of the\\r\\nfaubourgs nearly under my horse’s feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHard by, in the hole of the “320,” Lace’s half-section has placed its\\r\\nbattery. I had approached it without seeing it as I drew back under the\\r\\nthreat of the bomb.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say, how long are you going to let him do that?” I ask.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let him do it!... You don’t mean that, Margis. He won’t blow on his\\r\\nsauerkraut this evening.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait and see what sort of a menu we’re going to serve that ace.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Grizard, an actor in the suburban theaters, speaking. He looks\\r\\nlike the best natured and quietest of men, but he is a pitiless pointer\\r\\nwho never lets his prey escape.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me play a little, Margis. See how pretty he is, how fine, and how\\r\\nwell he flies. It is too bad, a pretty little canary like that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! Attention, ladies and gentlemen. Two turns, and at three we will\\r\\ncommence. You’ll see what you will see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On with the music.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the music begins the dance. First, come slow shots, rhythmic and\\r\\nirregular tac-tacs, spaced like the prelude to a slow waltz. Grizard is\\r\\nsearching for the tune; then, gradually, he accelerates the time, and the\\r\\ntac-tac becomes faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow he has the aeroplane in his field of fire ... the bullets dance\\r\\naround him in a ring of fire, without a break ... the dance of death!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the circle grows narrower and narrower, infernal, pitiless.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone looks; there is nothing to see up there; bullets are elusive and\\r\\ninvisible, but we make out the drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his rapid evolutions, his sharp darts back and forth, his irregular\\r\\nand hurried spirals, we understand that the aviator has already been\\r\\nreached but is trying to baffle the fire which pursues him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tac-tac continues. It is incessant, implacable, ferocious. The\\r\\nsilence of death hovers over men and things. All Nature seems to await\\r\\nthe issue of the combat which is no longer doubtful.\\r\\n\\r\\nI look at Grizard. Hand on the handle of the gun, he follows the\\r\\nevolutions of the aeroplane; his eyes shine as at a good trick he is\\r\\nplaying on the acrobat up there, and softly, with all the desired\\r\\nexpressions, as if he were before his audience at Belleville or at the\\r\\nGaîté-Montparnasse, he hums:\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Rêve de valse, rêve d’un jour,_\\r\\n    _Valse de rêve, valse d’amour._\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s hit,” Sergeant Lace cries suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd indeed he is hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wings waver, bend, warp, and abruptly fall in a spiral, while an\\r\\nimmense burst of flame, which the speed increases immoderately, rises and\\r\\nmarks the limpid blue of the sky with a long red thread which dissolves\\r\\nin the heavens in a trail of gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a noise of broken iron, tearing canvas, explosions which recall\\r\\nfireworks, the machine smashes into the fields, right where the last bomb\\r\\nhad destroyed the peaceful herd of cows a moment ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe run from all directions, but there is nothing to see. The aeroplane\\r\\nwas completely destroyed by the fall and the fire, and ends by burning\\r\\nitself up.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is impossible to get the charred body of the aviator out from the\\r\\nsmoking ruins.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizard is on the scene with his gun crew, and examines his target.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good shot!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe congratulate him and begin to go back. But Grizard is a comedian who\\r\\nknows his business and who has perhaps played a rôle in the circuits in\\r\\nfaraway provinces, and he is not a man to miss an effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stands by the roadside in the courteous attitude of Cyrano de Bergerac\\r\\npointing out the way to the Count de Guiche after amusing him for a\\r\\nquarter of an hour. And Grizard, who has amused us for a quarter of an\\r\\nhour, but in another way, points out the road and says:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The quarter of an hour is past, Messieurs. I release you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\nDAYS IN CANTONMENT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regiment is holding the first line trenches in front of the La Vache\\r\\nwoods. When the company is in the lines, the echelons, the war train, and\\r\\nthe clerks remain behind in the cantonment at Morcourt.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorcourt is a delightful little village hidden in the green meadows under\\r\\nthe poplars on the banks of the canal of the Somme. Morcourt was once\\r\\na hamlet of one hundred and fifty houses and their flower gardens, but\\r\\nto-day it is a real village where there are crowded together a population\\r\\nof more than ten thousand men. More than twenty thousand horses are\\r\\nbivouacked in the neighboring villages of Proyart, Lamotte, Bayonvillers,\\r\\nwhich have no water, and they come to Morcourt twice a day to dry up the\\r\\nwatering places.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur quarters here are in the open fields. Everybody can’t have covered\\r\\nshelters. The major of the cantonment showed us the field and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Try to make shift with that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we did.\\r\\n\\r\\nLess than an hour later the grass was mowed, ground down by our haltered\\r\\nhorses, who devoured it with their sharp teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond, on the edge of the road, in impeccable alignment our sixteen\\r\\nammunition wagons are parked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind are the horses, the huts of the four sections of the echelon, and\\r\\nthe war train.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at the end the four large caissons of ammunition and the munition\\r\\nwagons.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurette and Morin, the clerks, cannot make a simple tent do. More\\r\\ncomfortable quarters are necessary for their work.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a day of hunting around Burette came back to camp, radiant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Mon vieux_, I’ve found something wonderful. We’ll live like princes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where did you get it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some fine people. It’s next to the mayor’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Mince!_ You look well. Did they offer you the house?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll see. It’s better than that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Better than that!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stamped our feet in impatience. Such a windfall is worth while. If we\\r\\nstay here a whole month we shall be well lodged.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was already rejoicing in the thought of being able to build a\\r\\ncomfortable bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaux, on whom devolved the delicate and most often difficult care of our\\r\\ngetting moved, foresaw innumerable conveniences.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorin alone remained sceptical. He is that temperamentally.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sees no good in this north country. He has been morose ever since\\r\\nhe left Provence, and he won’t smile again until he hears tinkle in\\r\\nhis ravished ears the familiar evocative sonorities of Avignon, Arles,\\r\\nMiramas, Le Pas des Lanciers, L’Estaque. The sun, the blue sky, the blue\\r\\nsea!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd how right Morin is!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun exaggerates, but in openness and beauty. The fogs are\\r\\ndeceitful.... Far better to be dazzled than deceived....\\r\\n\\r\\nMorin distrusts the splendid cantonment of Morcourt. He knows those at\\r\\nProyart, Chuignolles, Minacourt, Virginy ... and others besides....\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, for the commonest hut, the most modest cabin, ruined though it be\\r\\nand sordid, but haloed in the sun, flooded with clear light, bathed in\\r\\nthe silver foliage of the olives, planted down there on the rocks of\\r\\nPointe-Rouge or of L’Estaque, beside the sea, sheltered in the valleys of\\r\\nCamions, or perched on the hills of Allauch! How much better it is, how\\r\\nmuch better worth living in, than the most sumptuous castles buried in\\r\\nthe damp forests where the stones are green under the moss.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh on a hill on the road to Harbonnières opens the courtyard of a farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurette leads us there in triumph. It is his discovery. He crosses the\\r\\ncourt, and opens majestically a small low door, with a barrel on each\\r\\nside in which stunted geraniums vegetate miserably.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is an old pig-sty!\\r\\n\\r\\nScraped and washed with a lot of water, it will be habitable. We’ll make\\r\\nsomething out of it. Burette borrows a long table and at once covers it\\r\\nwith his innumerable account books. We make our beds against the walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty ammunition caissons placed in double rows, a mattress stuffed with\\r\\nhay, a tent cloth, two covers—that’s our camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe corner at the back falls to Morin. It is the longest way of the room\\r\\nand he can stretch out his whole tall form at his ease, which he rarely\\r\\nfinds it possible to do in the cantonments.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight reserves various distractions for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the rats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rats descended from the dove-cote in a dense horde and\\r\\nmade incursions on our haversacks, in mad gallops over our bed\\r\\nclothes—gigantic rats with interminable tails!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey used the open space between the beds as their lists and had real\\r\\nbattles, biting, crying and moaning. The routed fugitives jumped over\\r\\nMorin’s body to get to shelter and he shivered in terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurette decided to try extreme measures, for hunting them with shoes\\r\\nhas no effect. So he begins to sing one of the most beautiful tunes in\\r\\nhis repertoire called “A Montparnasse.” It must have thirty verses, all\\r\\nending in an interminable “nasse ... nasse ... nasse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems that it was a triumph of the boulevards, and no true lover of\\r\\nsongs should be ignorant of it. Very possibly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rats must have shared my opinion, however, for they seemed to like\\r\\nthe great triumph of the boulevards only moderately, but they remained\\r\\nquiet while the song lasted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat song had another virtue, too. It put me to sleep and Burette as\\r\\nwell. His voice dragged more and more, and grew more feeble, when a\\r\\nterrible cry pierced the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorin shouted in terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe jumped for our electric lamps.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir dim rays brighten the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove Morin’s head, through a hole in the mud wall which separates us\\r\\nfrom the neighboring stable, a calf—a young calf—gracious and smiling,\\r\\nhas stuck his great red head, and has imprinted a caress on the face of\\r\\nour sleeping friend with his milky tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The salaud! He has bitten me,” grumbled Morin, wiping off the dribble\\r\\nwhich stuck to his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get out, animal.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the calf was insensible to this harsh invitation. He continued to\\r\\nendure the flashes from our lights with a placid eye, and, drawn no\\r\\ndoubt by Burette’s song, which seemed to him like familiar news, he began\\r\\nto bellow, waking up the whole stable, and the cows added their powerful\\r\\nvoices to that of their offspring.... We slept no more that night.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe days which followed were not all exactly alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant sent us word by a cyclist to come and see him in the lines\\r\\nand get the list of changes to be made among the men and horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe started at daylight and went in the company wagon as far as Froissy.\\r\\nWhen we got there, Morin told me that he knew a wonderful short cut\\r\\nwhich avoided the great détour by Éclusier, and led directly to the\\r\\ncommunication trench. Walking in the wet meadows where we sank in up to\\r\\nour ankles had little attraction for me. I preferred the hard highway\\r\\nand the towpath, but Morin knew the country and claimed that we would\\r\\nonly have several hundred yards of bad walking and then we would reach a\\r\\npracticable path.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe walked more than an hour. The fog grew thicker and thicker, limiting\\r\\nour horizon to a few steps. There was never anyone in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Morin,” I said, “if your short cut is as wonderful as you say,\\r\\nit must be known. But at the moment it seems somewhat deserted to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMorin did not reply. There was no doubt that he wasn’t certain of his\\r\\nway, but he did not dare to admit his mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather inclined one to melancholy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe walked on in silence. The path was very narrow and we were obliged to\\r\\nwalk one behind the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sinister grumbling seemed to shatter the heavens above the fog.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstinctively we hurled ourselves to the ground into the wet grass and\\r\\nmud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shell passed over us and buried itself in the ground without\\r\\nexploding.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This quarter hardly seems the safest in the world, Morin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re firing on the battery of ‘75’s’.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A battery of ‘75’s’? What battery?... Where have you seen a battery?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough he was seriously disturbed about our direction, Morin would not\\r\\nbudge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: A SINISTER GRUMBLING SEEMED TO SHATTER THE FOG _See page\\r\\n110_]\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was there day before yesterday. It must have moved.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose you’re sure your short cut hasn’t changed its place.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI had scarcely spoken when a shell followed the direction of the first\\r\\nand exploded beside us, throwing up a mass of mud, grass and water.\\r\\nThe ground was soft and unfavorable for deadly splinters. In any other\\r\\nterrain we would have been hit seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time Morin hesitated,\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m afraid I’m mistaken!...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was sure of it a long time ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let’s go on just the same; this must bring us out somewhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s my opinion, too.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fog was still heavy. We walked in a cloud the length of an\\r\\ninterminable trench recently cut in the clay. The bottom was full of\\r\\nwater. It leads us in an unknown direction. How can we find out what way\\r\\nwe are going? Where are we? We follow its windings for half an hour and\\r\\nclamber over crossings. Perhaps we’re going around in a circle. The mist\\r\\nis about us all the time. We can see nothing. Not a landmark.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the distance far to the north, in the English sector, a heavy gun\\r\\nhammers the air with loud regular shots. We started out at daybreak to go\\r\\nten miles. It is ten o’clock now and we have no idea where we are.\\r\\n\\r\\nI get impatient and begin to grumble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe air becomes fresher, and a fairly strong breeze comes up. In a few\\r\\nseconds the blue sky reappears above our heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn front of us forms stand out—trees, shattered trees, stretching their\\r\\ndead branches like broken arms, and seeming to cry to heaven in entreaty\\r\\nfor the martyred earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The La Vache woods!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are in the La Vache woods within sight of the enemy’s lines. Thirty\\r\\nyards from them! We are on the further side of the trenches, where the\\r\\nterrific storm of shells rages daily. We have the honor of being the\\r\\nfinest target that will ever be offered for a shot with a grenade.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe throw ourselves flat, but the embankment overhangs the lines so much\\r\\nthat even crawling is only a moderate safeguard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nom de Dieu! I’ll remember your short cut! To go to the Boches it’s the\\r\\nbest ever!...”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe slide along on elbows, stomach and knees like snakes, which puts our\\r\\nclothes to a severe test. And we let ourselves fall head first into the\\r\\n“Servian” trench, just over the lieutenant’s sap, who cannot believe his\\r\\neyes when he sees us fall as from the moon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where did you come from?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve been taking a walk in the La Vache woods. Does that mean anything\\r\\nto you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did you come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By a short cut!... a fine short cut, you know. I recommend it to you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSub-Lieutenant Delpos was making his rounds in the sector and was told\\r\\nof the exploit. He is nervous and in a murderous humor, for he spent a\\r\\nsleepless night on a special mission between the lines. So Morin caught\\r\\nit a hundred times worse than he deserved. Sub-Lieutenant Delpos’s\\r\\nmoments of ill humor are, like some storms, violent but quickly over.\\r\\nThe adventure ended with an excellent cup of coffee, flavored with XXX\\r\\nbrandy, which he offers us in his sap, sumptuously furnished with every\\r\\npossible comfort, twelve yards underground.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards midnight I went down to Éclusier through an English observation\\r\\ntrench. It is only accessible at night. In the daytime a Boche machine\\r\\ngun is placed on the other side of the Somme and enfilades it. It is\\r\\nsuicide to venture there. Cut out of the rock in the hillside, its ridges\\r\\nare short and steep. It is a bad trench, but an important short cut....\\r\\nSaux should be waiting for me with the horses in a ruined house behind\\r\\nthe church.\\r\\n\\r\\nÉclusier is a hamlet on the left side of the canal. There is a single\\r\\nstreet with ragged houses on each side, but they are not badly ruined.\\r\\nThe church, protected by a bend in the cliff, still has its steeple\\r\\nintact through some prodigy of equilibrium, although the roof has fallen\\r\\nin. At the side, in what was once the presbytery, is the regimental\\r\\ndressing station.\\r\\n\\r\\nLights come and go.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen are coming back from fatigue duty, searching for their dugouts\\r\\nby feeling for them. Through the air-holes, from which come odors of\\r\\ncooking, one can see lighted cellars.\\r\\n\\r\\nI make my way by the aid of my electric lamp through this labyrinth\\r\\nwhich was once a street, and I find the house. I guess at it, rather,\\r\\nfrom the pawing of the horses, which are nervous and are pounding on\\r\\nthe flagstones. It is an old grocery and its sign still reads: “Fine\\r\\nWines—Desserts—Choice Preserves.” A ragged green cart cover takes the\\r\\nplace of the door. I raise it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA gust of foul air hits me in the face, and I stop on the threshold\\r\\ngasping for breath. I see Saux asleep, his head on my saddle, and rolled\\r\\nup in horse blankets. Burette is asleep beside him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurette, the quartermaster, spent three months in the heavy artillery.\\r\\nHe is an enthusiast on horses, but his equestrian ability is far from\\r\\nequaling his love for it. His style produces many falls, but they don’t\\r\\ndiscourage him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wake up Saux, who gets up dizzily. Is he half drunk, I ask myself.\\r\\nThat’s not like him at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look, Saux, what’s the matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Saux leaned against the partition, searching for the door with his\\r\\nhaggard eyes. He dashed outside seized by nausea. The noise woke up\\r\\nBurette, and he too got up with difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say, what have you two been up to?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, _mon pauvre vieux_, I don’t know, but I’m sick.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The fact is there is considerable of an odor here; you might have found\\r\\na better....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horses are troubled by it, too. Kiki jumps about and paws furiously.\\r\\nBurette’s and Saux’s horses are sleeping heavily and their breathing is\\r\\ndifficult and oppressive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s something wrong somewhere, although the enemy hasn’t sent over\\r\\nany gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the aid of a light we poke about in the dark. I see a pile of\\r\\ncanvas in the corner of the room which is oozing with dampness. I raise\\r\\nthe bottom of the canvas with my stick and a swarm of great flies comes\\r\\nbuzzing out around us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are the bodies of German soldiers abandoned for no one knows how\\r\\nlong. Weeks, perhaps; since the attack on Fries without doubt. The blue\\r\\nswollen flesh is spotted by bites made by the teeth of rats. They are\\r\\nrotting and filling the soil with purulent matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith their monstrous faces, sunken eyes, cheeks fallen in, and their\\r\\nmouths convulsed by their last struggles, they seem still to shout with\\r\\nthe fright of their last hours. Burette and Saux have slept beside this\\r\\ncharnel-house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe lead out the horses in a hurry and saddle them in the open air. We\\r\\ngain the hard towpath, the only practicable way, and go on at a lively\\r\\npace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first light of dawn appears. At the bridge at Éclusier we stop a\\r\\nminute before climbing into the saddle. The Territorials there offer us\\r\\na cup of coffee. It warms us, for the morning fog on the Somme is always\\r\\ncold.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To horse!”\\r\\n\\r\\nI decide to go at a good pace as far as the bridge at Froissy and take\\r\\nthe lead. We must get along before the towpath is encumbered by all the\\r\\nloafers of the companies which are resting in the huts along the length\\r\\nof the canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nA battery of “75’s” in position near the military cemetery at Cappy is\\r\\nfiring shells.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe pass very close to some guns as they are starting off. Coquet is\\r\\nfrightened, jumps, and dashes into the fields, heading straight toward\\r\\nthe hedges of some vegetable gardens.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Attention! Burette, pull on the bits.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be afraid. He knows me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knows him so well that Burette had scarcely spoken than Coquet stopped\\r\\nshort before the fence. Burette went over alone, head first, and landed\\r\\nin the vegetables. Fortunately, the ground is soft, but in hurdling the\\r\\nobstacle he bumped into some bushes, and gets an eye bruised and a cheek\\r\\nscratched.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s nothing. That’s all right,” he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe remounts his horse, laughing and singing:\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Ah! les p’tits pois, les p’tits pois,_\\r\\n    _C’est un légume très tendre._\\r\\n\\r\\nHe can appreciate them this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWe meet Hémin, our comrade of the third company of machine guns, at\\r\\nFroissy. He came out at dawn with orders from his commandant and is going\\r\\nback to Morcourt, and we go along together.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing from this bridge to that at Méricourt, the towpath is almost\\r\\ndeserted. Hardly anything crosses our path except some English\\r\\nmotor-cyclists.\\r\\n\\r\\nHémin is riding a superb charger, a great long-legged, bright chestnut,\\r\\nwho carries his head proudly—a fine beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome yards away from the branch from Neuville marines from the gunboats\\r\\nhave planted huts along the towpath between the poplars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regular trot of our horses sounds clearly along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nA marine hears us and raises the flap of his tent to see us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis frightens Hémin’s horse and he jumps into the canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur comrade is unhorsed and disappears under the water. We jump down. But\\r\\neven before we jump two marines have plunged in. Others poke around with\\r\\npoles in the mud from a boat. In an eddy a hand appears, then a head,\\r\\nswollen, bloody, crushed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHémin got a blow from a shoe full in the face and could not swim.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe body is brought on to the bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nA surgeon from the gunboat doubles his efforts in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHémin is dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWe buried him in the little cemetery at Méricourt one Sunday morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the ideal cemetery of the poets, hidden in green from every sound.\\r\\nEach grave seems alone in a thicket of lilacs and honeysuckle. No\\r\\nscientific gardening here; no trees butchered by experts; no cultivated\\r\\nflowers; no bombastic marbles. The grass overruns the paths; the simple\\r\\nflowers of the field have blossomed on the graves, thus bringing in every\\r\\nseason the natural homage which returning life pays to the dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nNature is pleased to shut every sound from this field of rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of a lane, at the foot of a willow, we lay Hémin to rest in\\r\\nhis last sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men of the echelon come, the major, a captain, and the officers\\r\\nwho knew him particularly well. The intelligence officers of the three\\r\\ncompanies joined in buying a wreath and came to the services together.\\r\\n\\r\\nHémin’s captain speaks a few words. It is not the time for a long talk,\\r\\nfor a simple touching farewell is sufficient.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd before he goes each one throws in the grave the symbolic bit of earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSad duty!\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the grave is filled in I drop over him petals of peonies....\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor fellow! He is not the most unfortunate. He is in that luminous land\\r\\nof day and knows what we are powerless to know. He has finished with\\r\\nour poor human troubles, and on him have fallen the curtains of his last\\r\\nresting place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut those who are left, his wife, his child!... That is where sorrow\\r\\nbegins. They don’t know yet, and for a long time they will know nothing\\r\\nand will live in anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-day, at the very hour perhaps, when we let him down in his last\\r\\nresting place, his wife received the letter he wrote her yesterday\\r\\nmorning. She read this letter to her child, this letter in which he\\r\\nannounces his next arrival on leave, where he said to her,\\r\\n\\r\\n“In a week or two I shall be with you without a doubt.” He never will\\r\\nbe now, or, rather, he is there already, for the immaterial presence of\\r\\nloved ones accompanies us, if it is true that they are loved and are not\\r\\nforgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd pensively, under the fine rain which is falling, we return to our\\r\\ncantonments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\nAN ORDINARY FATIGUE PARTY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis evening the first section has to go on the works. The men have eaten\\r\\nearlier than usual, and they are on the road before nightfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe column remains in good order to the end of the cantonment, but once\\r\\nacross the passage by the knotty elm at Harbonnières, it breaks ranks.\\r\\nEach one goes along as he likes, talking or alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is madness in the air. We prefer another order of things than to\\r\\nspend one evening out of two in the first line digging in the mud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rather the trenches where we can snooze in peace,” they say.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe column trails along. Pierron, the sergeant who leads it, pays no\\r\\nattention. With Millazo, a tradesman from Hanoï who has arrived just\\r\\nrecently, he talks of Indo-China, of Saigon, and their gardens.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had scarcely arrived at the end of the sunken road which opens out on\\r\\nan uncovered slope on top of a ridge than a well-known whistling shatters\\r\\nspace. Each of us throws himself on the ground, in a ditch behind a tree,\\r\\nand the shell passes over us in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That wasn’t meant for us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen another, still another, and dozens like it; we count up to sixty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“M ... what are they having at Proyart for dessert?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is all the concern they have about what is going on in the rear, or\\r\\nabout the havoc and death the bombardment is launching at this moment\\r\\non the cantonment where their comrades live. That is the egotistical\\r\\nindifference which long experience with danger gives, and the constant\\r\\ncontemplation of death. The column marches along more carefully and\\r\\nwider awake, concealing themselves from the view of the enemy’s aerial\\r\\nobservers which are to be seen high on the horizon in spite of the late\\r\\nhour and the twilight which has already begun to grow dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you suppose they’ve forgotten the sausage?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sometimes they stay out to give us a shot.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we wait until it is very dark before we reach our position in the\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place where we have to dig is in the front lines. We have to\\r\\nconstruct circular dugouts for machine guns, with their rounded\\r\\nplatforms, and to connect them with the trench by underground trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe climb over the trench carrying our tools in our hands and slip between\\r\\nthe barbed wire, but we have scarcely gone a yard when a heavy fusillade\\r\\nwarns us that this time we are spotted. We dig in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is anyone hit?”\\r\\n\\r\\nNo reply, no groans; everyone is there, flat, stretched out. We wait flat\\r\\nin the grass and the mud until the star shells fall, and as soon as one\\r\\nhas, and before the following one has scaled through space and lighted\\r\\nit with its dim light, we jump into the hole which the fatigue party of\\r\\nyesterday dug.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the tools aren’t idle, although we guess rather than hear the blows\\r\\nof the pick digging in the deep rich earth and the shovelers throwing it\\r\\nout as far on the parapet as possible so as not to form a salient.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe dig for hours without interruption, lowering our heads in the holes\\r\\nas the star shells go up, and taking up our tasks as soon as it is dark\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy has discovered the time of our fatigue parties, and to-morrow\\r\\nit will know the exact position of our work, so that it will be somewhat\\r\\nuncomfortable to continue. It must be finished to-night.\\r\\n\\r\\nA company of Territorials is stretching barbed wire on our right.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween each star shell we can hear the hammering of the sledges\\r\\nagainst the stakes, the strain of the tension on the wire, and when the\\r\\ntraitorous light shines again these wonderful workers don’t even hide.\\r\\nThey remain hanging on the barbed wire, motionless and disjointed like\\r\\ncorpses. They look so much like them that the enemy doesn’t even fire,\\r\\nas he feels certain that he has annihilated this gang which heroically\\r\\ncontinues its gigantic task.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look!... they’re like statues.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One would think it was a party ... there are the lights and the\\r\\norchestra.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time for supplying the company in the lines comes. The men of the\\r\\nfield kitchens come by groups of three or four from the trenches just\\r\\nbehind us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first two have a long rod on their shoulders and rolls of bread on\\r\\nthis. Others carry in canvas pails and kettles come from nowhere the\\r\\ncoveted wine and the aromatic brandy. Others bend under the weight of\\r\\npots which hold lumpy black bean soup, which splashes out at every jolt\\r\\nin the path. It is already cold and greasy. Finally, the mess corporal\\r\\nreaches the end of his trip and draws out of his sack the desserts bought\\r\\nwith the mess balance and the commissions given to him the day before\\r\\nby the men in the trenches. The pockets of his jackets are full of\\r\\nletters he has just received from the officer with the mail, and which he\\r\\ndelivers to the men who have been waiting for them hungrily.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he gets as far as the fatigue party he stops and hesitates. He must\\r\\ngo over a space of fifty yards, absolutely exposed, to the edge of a\\r\\ngroup of trees where there is a first-line trench taken from the Boches\\r\\nin the last attack and not yet connected with the communication trench.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has reason for his hesitation, for the last two days the Boche trench\\r\\non our left has been firing on it heavily.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay before yesterday an entire fatigue party was killed. We can see\\r\\nthere in front of us the abandoned sacks and scattered packages. Five\\r\\nmen out of eight were killed yesterday. The others were able to get over\\r\\nsome of the provisions and the bad news by crawling, and at the price\\r\\nof a thousand risks. They also took the rest of the provisions from the\\r\\nbodies of their comrades who carried them. To-day they advanced the time\\r\\nof bringing the supplies an hour in order to foil the enemy’s vigilance.\\r\\nThis time the mess corporal accompanied the fatigue party himself to\\r\\ndiscover, if possible, a less perilous mode of communication. But the\\r\\nBoches must have been on the watch, or guessed or got wind of it somehow.\\r\\nThe star shells now follow each other with no let-up, lighting up the\\r\\nroad so that one can’t venture on it. Under this too persistent light the\\r\\nTerritorials abandon their simulation of corpses and seek shelter in the\\r\\ntrench to which we are getting ready to return.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is necessary for the supplies to go on. The company in the front line\\r\\nhas had only insufficient provisions for two days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mess corporal is a brave man and makes several attempts to venture\\r\\noutside, but each time he is received by a fusillade and only has time to\\r\\nthrow himself backward in the trench.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fatigue party has been watched and waited for.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hold a council of the non-commissioned officers and the lieutenant of\\r\\nthe Territorials which has held the position for several weeks. Various\\r\\nstratagems are proposed and we weigh the chances, but after consideration\\r\\nall of them are vetoed. It is impossible to get by even at the greatest\\r\\nspeed without risking the lives of several men, and perhaps of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, if we were able to draw the attention of the Boches, to occupy\\r\\nthem with something else, to enfilade them, to shell them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Enfilade them ... shell them....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Isn’t there some place from which we can enfilade them?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we all considered in our minds the position of the Boche trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We can’t do anything from here,” said a sergeant who had spent various\\r\\nperiods in these trenches for several months, and knew every corner of\\r\\nit; “but below there to the left, about a hundred yards from the picket\\r\\npost, is a ruined cabin which dominates everything. But there’s nothing\\r\\ndoing in getting there; it’s too near; they’d see us as plain as day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of our men heard all this. And while the conversation went on, I saw\\r\\nhim climb up on the parapet and examine the position.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Marseille, an impetuous, headstrong type. He rebelled at all\\r\\ndiscipline, he was restive under observation, but his bravery was\\r\\nunfailing, and he was absolutely oblivious to danger, which he ignored\\r\\nwith a swagger and indifference which seemed amazing. Marseille has known\\r\\none hundred thousand adventures and turned one hundred thousand tricks,\\r\\nand has always come back absolutely unharmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was on his last leave he spent six unrestrained days in\\r\\ninnumerable drinking bouts in all the bars at La Cannebière, where he\\r\\nnarrated his boasted deeds of prowess, which were probably much inferior\\r\\nto the real ones. Then, instead of going back, he waited for them to come\\r\\nand get him. He was arrested on the eighth day and brought back to the\\r\\nCorps by the provost. Marseille was not the least upset when the officer\\r\\ndemanded the reasons for his delay, and replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t like to travel alone. I like society, I do. So I have had a\\r\\nwhole car to myself and my escort. And besides, I knew very well that the\\r\\ngendarmes wouldn’t come from Marseilles here without buying a drink, and\\r\\nthey wouldn’t have the nerve to lap it all up without offering me some. I\\r\\nlike the gendarmes. That may seem strange to you, but I do.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMarseille is a good singer and his number appears in all the company\\r\\nconcerts. His throat is as clear as the sunny lights of La Corniche and\\r\\nL’Esterel, and he can render the final trills of the Neapolitan songs\\r\\nwith the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had finished his rapid observation he came back to our anxious\\r\\ngroup and spoke to the mess corporal:\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll be all right, _mon vieux_. You’ll get there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we all looked at him in open-mouthed surprise at such assurance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you any news or an idea? Explain. Tell us something about it. Let\\r\\nus see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll get there, as I told you. Don’t bother about those fellows over\\r\\nthere. That’s my job. Watch me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to the lieutenant who was getting ready to question him:\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have a machine gun, haven’t you, Lieutenant.... Won’t you lend it\\r\\nto me ... just a minute? It’s a Saint Etienne. I know that.... I know\\r\\nthem all.... They’re all the same.... And five belts with it to amuse the\\r\\nBoches for five minutes.... That’ll be enough for the cooks to get over.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe understood it all, and we laughed and admired him. Marseille rolled\\r\\nup the barrel of the machine gun and the belts in several thicknesses of\\r\\ncanvas, tied a rope to it and attached the other end to his wrist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hold on to the package so that it won’t make trouble on the stones, and\\r\\nwhen I pull on the rope twice, let it come.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he crawled out of the trench and slid down towards the ruined hut.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe waited anxiously the full ten minutes. We watched the cord unroll\\r\\nwith varying emotions. It stopped, stood still, immovable. Has he arrived?\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we felt the two jerks, and the lieutenant let the heavy package\\r\\nslide, and it got mixed up in the stakes, rocks, and gullies, and made\\r\\nsuch a metallic noise that it could not help attracting the Boche’s\\r\\nattention. And it had an effect. The enemy believed that we were making\\r\\nsome sort of a movement, and launched in our direction a heavy fusillade\\r\\nwhich we refrained from answering.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain ten minutes passed ... they were interminable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen suddenly came the machine gun ... ours ... Marseille’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly at first, it sent out its irregular tap-tap, then the cadence\\r\\nbecame faster, and then a steady crackle. The Boches were taken in the\\r\\nflank and thought that we were making an attack, and Marseille, who saw\\r\\nthem running by the light of their star shells, shouted out,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Forward, the cooks, run, nom de Dieu!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fatigue party rushed out at top speed. Soup spatters from all sides.\\r\\nThe rations of wine and coffee will be short. The men disappear in the\\r\\nwood. They are over; they are safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the German bullets are raging to our left about the hut; rockets go\\r\\nup asking for artillery. In front of our lines close to us explosions\\r\\nrock the ground. Their artillery is firing in the right place. The\\r\\nfatigue party is over but the Boches have another prey. By this time\\r\\nMarseille is stewing away in the ruins of his shelter.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the shelling lasts we discuss his last feat, safe in the sap, while\\r\\nwe munch the last of our cold repast. Then, as dawn begins to appear and\\r\\nwe have to return to the cantonment at daybreak, we begin to get ready to\\r\\ngo. Before we go we share a bucket of wine which the overloaded fatigue\\r\\nparty couldn’t carry in its dash and abandoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a shadow stands before us in the sap.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So they share their leavings and there is none for the hungry?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is Marseille, safe and sound, whole, without a scratch. Everyone\\r\\ncrowds around him, and the officer runs up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now, if you’ll pull in that string, you’ll bring back the tools.\\r\\nI’m sore on that machine. You know, Lieutenant, that gun wasn’t our\\r\\nHotchkiss. I had to dismantle the breech; it jammed at once. I couldn’t\\r\\nhave fired more than half a belt. Fortunately, they gave me light with\\r\\ntheir star shells; I couldn’t have done it without them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\nWITH MUSIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are in reserve cantonments at Chuignolles, and we all lodge together\\r\\nat the end of the village, near the church, in a large house, which\\r\\nisn’t injured much and which once served the servants of the presbytery.\\r\\nWe were shaken up in our last action, and they give us comparatively\\r\\ngenerous liberty, no manœuvres, no reviews, and no drills. The section\\r\\nleaders have seen to the arms and ammunition and have secured an entirely\\r\\nnew equipment from the ordnance officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe infantry have turned gunners over to us to fill up our ranks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant recommends the men to distract themselves with games,\\r\\ngossip and songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt his solicitation we organized a concert, several concerts, in fact.\\r\\nEach section has its artists which it believes in and of which it is\\r\\nproud.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening in the garden adjoining the officers’ quarters we were\\r\\nendeavoring to draw out the meal by chatting, but conversation flagged as\\r\\nnight drew near. So Sub-Lieutenant Delpos, who was opposed to dreaming as\\r\\nengendering melancholy, demanded a concert at once, immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cantonments were scattered about in the surrounding gardens.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Croharé,” he said, “run to each section and bring back artists—all the\\r\\nartists in each company must be here in five minutes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd five minutes later they were there. All the company, too, for each\\r\\nsection followed its artists, who were to shine in all the glory of their\\r\\nrepertoire before the officers and the “little staff.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had singers, comedians and speakers, professional and amateur. Jacquet\\r\\ngave with exquisite artistry several delightful songs, the words of\\r\\nwhich he had composed and adapted to well-known tunes. The “Lettre à la\\r\\nMarriane” was really touching.\\r\\n\\r\\nGaix and Corporal Vail sang with real talent and gave us a full\\r\\nrepertoire from the operas. The indefatigable Marseille gave, in a\\r\\nhilarious gibberish, an Italian-Marseilles thing which brought down the\\r\\nhouse with wild laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s too bad we haven’t a piano to play the accompaniments,” said\\r\\nsomeone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A piano! I’ll attend to that,” said the ever-resourceful Chevalier.\\r\\n“Four men in my bunch, and I’ll bring it at once.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSome minutes later the party brought in an enormous harmonium which it\\r\\nhad found in a room of the presbytery. That harmonium had been the silent\\r\\nwitness of famous battles, had been taken and retaken with the village.\\r\\nIt had played “Die Wacht am Rhein” under the German heel, the “Rêve\\r\\nPasse” with the artillery, “Sidi-Brahim” with our Blue Devils, and it was\\r\\nstill in good condition and almost all the notes played.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now we have a piano, we must have a player.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, there, ‘Father Music.’ You know this is your job. You played for us\\r\\nlast summer in the church at Minaucourt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Father Music” smiled gravely and pushed his way through the groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nA candle stuck in the neck of a champagne bottle and placed on the\\r\\nharmonium lighted up his Christlike face with a golden light.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seated himself, without stopping smiling, on a pile of ammunition\\r\\ncaissons which served as a piano stool, and—honor to whom honor is\\r\\ndue—since we are machine gunners, he begins the “Song of the Machine\\r\\nGun,” with Gaix singing the first stanza.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n“Father Music” stands out in the light in the middle of the dark night\\r\\nand this group of a hundred men who one surmises are there, rather than\\r\\nsees, squatting on the grass around the instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder his cap thrown back on his head the hair shows sparse and thin, his\\r\\nbeard is large and tangled, and he smiles through his large, clear eyes.\\r\\nHis lips move with the singer, and he sings the song with as much fervor\\r\\nand composure as if he were chanting a Halleluiah.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Father Music!” ...\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is a fine figure in our society, rich in epic types.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have seen him near us for some weeks, as much in our echelon as in\\r\\nthe company of which he assumes the duties of infirmary orderly. I have\\r\\nlearned to know him, and to know him is to love him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy scraps, by fragments of phrases, for he speaks but little—little of\\r\\nhimself, but instead launches out in real flights of declamation about an\\r\\nidea, a poem, a well-known tune, the names of artists—I have been able\\r\\nbit by bit and through deductions almost to reconstruct his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is a quiet man in all his ways, habits and ideas. He lived in the\\r\\nquarter of Saint-Sulpice in an old house in the quiet Rue Madame, and\\r\\nmade his living by giving music lessons in the institutions in the\\r\\nneighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey knew him in the quarter as “Monsieur Placide.” On the appointed\\r\\ndays at the same hours he went to the Nuns of the Immaculate Conception,\\r\\nto the Brothers of the Sacred Heart, or to special lessons in the city,\\r\\nwithout ever wandering far away from the quarter, in the old venerable\\r\\nhouses, in the Rues d’Assas and Garancière.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sundays he played the organ in a small chapel of the Visitation\\r\\nSisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people knew little about him through social intercourse, for he never\\r\\nwent out, or rarely. In summer he sometimes went to the Tuileries to\\r\\nlisten to secular music—and that is all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in August, 1914, the notices of mobilization called all able-bodied\\r\\nmen to arms, his orders were to join a regiment of Colonial infantry in\\r\\na fort around Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis man lived a regular life apart from dangerous contingencies, and was\\r\\nunacquainted with worldly ambitions and political strife, but he went\\r\\nto war knowing nothing of it, and considering it only a little and then\\r\\nthrough a professional view-point, as a sort of great drama in which he\\r\\nwas going to play a comparatively passive rôle.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the cap and great coat of the infantryman, bristling all over with\\r\\nequipment, he was the typical “poilu”—the poilu of tradition. His large\\r\\nbeard covered the front of his brown coat, and this gave him the proud\\r\\nappearance of a veteran.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first he was going to sacrifice this thick beard which he had spared\\r\\nsince his liberation from his regiment, but his officers wanted him to\\r\\nkeep it. That brought him a place at the head of the company on the\\r\\nmarch, and he drew all eyes. He was the poilu.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis reputation as a musician who played on any and all instruments was\\r\\nquickly known throughout the cantonments. So he was at all the ceremonies\\r\\nand all the merrymakings. In the morning on a harmonium carried to an\\r\\nopen field he might accompany a military mass said by stretcher-bearers,\\r\\nwhile that evening he might play on a chance piano, perhaps on the same\\r\\nharmonium, at improvised concerts, accompanying jolly, broad songs sung\\r\\nby amateurs and playing the national hymns of the Allies, and astonishing\\r\\neven himself in the patriotic choruses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this man to whom everything that was not classical or the Gregorian\\r\\nchant was strange, who for twenty years of his life had taught successive\\r\\ngenerations Méhul, Gluck, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, to whom Massenet,\\r\\nDelibes and Gounod seemed profane, surprised himself by pounding out on a\\r\\nbadly-tuned piano and singing with all his might the refrains of “Viens\\r\\nPoupoule,” popular marches, and the ballads of the faubourg.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldiers had quickly named him “Father Music” and this nickname\\r\\npleased him immensely.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night an order came from the commanding officer:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two companies of machine guns will go with the utmost haste to Hill 174,\\r\\nnorthwest of Herbècourt, to stop the enemy which is trying to outflank\\r\\nour right.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt three o’clock in the morning we were at the position indicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small chapel with a cross was situated on the top of the hill. The open\\r\\nspace in front commands the road which descends gradually toward the\\r\\nMéréaucourt woods where the enemy is concealed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe fortify our position in a few minutes. On both sides of the road a\\r\\ngun sweeps the slope and the approaches and guards the way out of the\\r\\nwoods. In the little belfry which is shaped like a dove-cote another gun\\r\\ncommands the woods and can disturb evolutions in the wood itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use the material at hand to fortify our emplacements—bits of benches,\\r\\na door of a confessional, and the railings of the chapel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt our right across the road a company of riflemen also establish\\r\\nentrenchments, so well camouflaged that the enemy cannot see them until\\r\\nin its zone of fire, that is to say, too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer, a young sub-lieutenant, asks us not to fire until he gives\\r\\nthe signal. He has the idea—and a good one—to let the enemy advance\\r\\nand come up the road. Here he would be unable to execute a converging\\r\\nmovement and our gun in the belfry would sweep the right side of the road\\r\\nand prevent his turning aside, the company of riflemen would protect the\\r\\nleft, and his section of Grenadiers would attack on the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are confident of the strength of our positions and our means of\\r\\nresistance, and we wait for the launching of the attack without anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Father Music” has organized his dressing station in the chapel in the\\r\\nshelter of the altar and now wanders around the building.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church recalls familiar surroundings to him and he delights in\\r\\nlooking at it. There are a few simple frescoes, pictures of the\\r\\nCrucifixion, where gigantic men stand out in relief against a background\\r\\nof microscopic mountains and Liliputian houses, and they interest him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lets his fingers wander over the keyboard of the harmonium which lies\\r\\nforgotten in the choir.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis comrades jeer,\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Father Music’ is going to play our _De Profundis_.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the quiet does not last long. Towards five o’clock a frightful fire\\r\\nbegins all at once. The troops in the front-line trenches, at the bottom\\r\\nof the hill, are decimated and cut down by a furious fire; they retreat\\r\\nand take refuge behind the defense works of the village.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe make our final preparations. Evidently the enemy is going to try to\\r\\ntake the village and has already begun its destruction. A storm of great\\r\\nshells falls on the trenches, very near us, some yards behind the houses.\\r\\nWe hear terrific explosions, the falling of roofs, and fires break out\\r\\neverywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn order from the commander of the sector reaches us, “Maintain the\\r\\nposition and hold on until the companies of reinforcements arrive.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bombardment becomes more and more violent. As the sound of each shell\\r\\nwhistles through the air we wonder if this infernal machine is going to\\r\\nstrike in our dugout this time. And every two minutes, mathematically,\\r\\nthe uproar comes again and this unimaginable suffering continues some\\r\\nhours. At the sound of each shell we close our eyes. We think of the\\r\\nloved ones with a calm certainty of never seeing them again. We begin to\\r\\nwish that it would end at once, rather than have to endure this terrible\\r\\nnervous tension longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the reinforcements cannot advance under the avalanche of fire and\\r\\nshell. Are they going to let us be massacred on the spot without defense?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Teuton artillery imagines that they have cleared the objective and\\r\\ntheir fire dies down. Cautiously but confident of their superiority and\\r\\ntactics, the Germans now appear in numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, violently, like a clap of thunder the “Marseillaise” bursts on\\r\\nour ears—tremendously.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt rushes out through all the breaches in the church; it comes through\\r\\nthe cracks; it goes up through the fallen roof; it traverses the\\r\\nshattered windows. It unites in itself all human and celestial voices.\\r\\nThe soul of a whole nation, the spirit of ancient glories, animates the\\r\\nold organ which sings its last song.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all the strength of its breath, with all the breath of its pipes,\\r\\nfilled to bursting, with all the sonority of its bass, its horns, its\\r\\nflutes and violins, the organ hurls forth the sacred song.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it is not only the hymn of triumphant Liberty and the indignation\\r\\nof an avenging people in the face of the invader. Magnified by the\\r\\nliturgical sounds on the ritualistic instrument of sacred music, it\\r\\nis the Hosanna of Glory, the Sursam Corda of Faith, confident in the\\r\\napproaching victory, the Resurexit of the triumphant Past, and the De\\r\\nProfundis of brutal domination.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd beside all that, all the songs of glory, all the exaltations of\\r\\nfaith, all the clamor of Gregorian theogony vibrate in the notes of the\\r\\n“Marseillaise.”\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the humble vault of a hamlet chapel the organ plays the\\r\\ntwice-blessed music, and intones the splendid Magnificat of the Republic,\\r\\nthe hymn of the Trinity, thrice human, thrice divine, Liberty, Fraternity\\r\\nand Equality.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, dominating all the sonorities of the organ, a thousand voices unite\\r\\nin a sublime burst of song,\\r\\n\\r\\n    “_Aux armes, citoyens!_ ...”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Grenades!” commands the lieutenant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men, electrified, mouths half open, the machines in their hands,\\r\\nspring out of the trench in the teeth of the enemy, but two steps from\\r\\nhim. And with an irresistible dash they charge him, follow him, crumble\\r\\nhim. The Teutons flee in terror....\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nNight has fallen. Under a sky reddened by the lights of fires deep\\r\\nsilence is over everything. Numerous reinforcements have arrived. The\\r\\nreconquered positions have been reorganized at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general has been told of the exploit and he congratulates the\\r\\nofficers and men, and promises them rewards. He also expresses a desire\\r\\nto see the church from which came the martial hymn which electrified the\\r\\ncompany.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll is dark....\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the back near the altar a small lantern lightens the darkness ... we\\r\\napproach.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the ruined harmonium, forever silent now, “Father Music” sleeps....\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\n“WE HAVE TAKEN A PICKET POST”\\r\\n\\r\\n(“Communique du”)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe asphyxiating shells which have been falling around us for forty-eight\\r\\nhours without a let-up have ceased. This morning the first rays of the\\r\\nsun filtered through the layers of gas and seemed to evaporate them. This\\r\\nlull was opportune. Our masks have long since been glued to our faces,\\r\\nand loosened by our heavy breathing they no longer adhere hermetically\\r\\nand begin to let in the toxins.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we are able to breathe at will and swallow our share of pure air.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur sap opens on the side of a great quarry and commands the whole valley\\r\\nof the Somme. At our feet is the canal and towpath, at the right in a\\r\\ngroup of trees in the middle of the marshes are the ruins of Froissy;\\r\\nopposite us, behind the buttress of the La Vache woods, is the steeple of\\r\\nÉclusier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe open space in front of our dugout forms a sort of terrace. Here we\\r\\nhave laid out tables and dug seats in the chalk of the quarry. Men are\\r\\ndescending by real scaling paths to get water from the canal, although it\\r\\nis against the major’s explicit orders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe towpath is visible from the enemy’s trenches on the other side of the\\r\\nSomme. During the preceding days, those who tried to follow it to get\\r\\nback to Éclusier more easily were wounded by the fire of a machine gun\\r\\nwhich sweeps the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur men come back from this expedition without accident, and we are able\\r\\nto proceed to our summary ablutions. We have not been able to do that for\\r\\nsix days, and it is a real delight to feel the fresh water on our eyes\\r\\nand to rid the skin of its sticky moisture.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of our sections hold the first-line trenches twenty yards in front of\\r\\nus. We must relieve them presently....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artillery is still silent, and without a doubt the enemy has given up\\r\\nthe stroke he was preparing. He was counting on the usual morning mist of\\r\\nthe Somme, but this morning the air is very clear without a suspicion of\\r\\nfog. A fresh breeze blows from the north.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we wait for the hour of relief, we talk, and an interminable game of\\r\\ncards goes on.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the dark dreary days of forced seclusion in the bottom of the sap\\r\\nI discovered a very fine fellow, one of our comrades whom I had not had\\r\\noccasion to notice until then. He was very simple, talked but little,\\r\\nlived by himself, and I did not know his name.\\r\\n\\r\\nChance placed us side by side and permitted me to engage him in\\r\\nconversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder a rough, taciturn appearance I found a soul full of kindness, a\\r\\nlife touched by sacrifice, kindly, modest, the heroism of the humble who\\r\\nlive simply for their long, hard tasks without complaining and without\\r\\nanyone being able to pity them in their sorrow and lighten their burdens.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night—was it night?—hermetically sealed in the deep sap, lighted only\\r\\nby the wavering light of scanty candles, all our hours were nocturnal.\\r\\nWithout the irregular arrival of supply parties we would have been\\r\\nabsolutely ignorant of the flight of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night, when the bombardment seemed to reach the final height of\\r\\nviolence, when each blow shook our dugout, and the props groaned and\\r\\nthreatened to yield—it would have been a merciless burial—our looks\\r\\ncrossed and I read in his eyes a deep sorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of my natural reserve, out of respect to his deep suffering I\\r\\nwas unable to contain myself long.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Comrade,” I said, “I read in your looks a great sorrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to come back to reality when he heard my voice!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fate has placed us near each other for some days. We don’t know what\\r\\nto-morrow may bring. Can’t I be of some use? Aid you in any way? Tell me!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes tried to smile a thanks. I saw his lips contract and then came\\r\\ntears, and before I could say anything he leaned his head on my shoulder\\r\\nand wept deeply.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not weakness, despair, or fear, but the unbridling of a heart shut\\r\\nup too long, the great gasp of a soul heavy with mental sorrows which\\r\\nmight at last open itself, the gentle rain which brought the stifling\\r\\nstorm of the nerves to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe confided his life history to me in a few words.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a simple artisan of the laboring class, and his life had been full\\r\\nof grief and sorrow. After some years of struggles, and cares and stress\\r\\ntogether with his beloved companion, a daughter was born. But in coming\\r\\ninto the world she took the life of her mother. And then he found himself\\r\\nalone in the world with this puny frail creature, born in grief and\\r\\nraised in sorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to his great love for her as a father he added his worship of\\r\\nthe departed one. He limited his life to his grief, and made his house a\\r\\nmemorial chapel where every object was a votive offering to his absent\\r\\nbeloved and a relic of the ever-present dead. He adorned the little girl\\r\\nwith her mother’s modest jewelry, and cut her clothes from those she had\\r\\nworn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough this double love which he poured out on this child, she became\\r\\nhis only reason for existence, his whole life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl was ten years old to-day. Brought up in the seclusion\\r\\nof the tabernacle, she had taken up her rôle conscientiously. She was\\r\\nquieter than most children of her age, and attentive to her father’s\\r\\nslightest wish. As she grew up she developed into the very image of her\\r\\nmother, and the poor man began to live again as in a dream the days of\\r\\nhis happy past.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen war broke out the implacable mobilization tore him from the fireside\\r\\nhe had never left before. Living alone as they did, they had no friends\\r\\nand knew of no relatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went, trusting the house to her and all their modest property, only\\r\\nrecommending her to the watch of a neighbor, of a concierge.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut fortified by example, she suddenly grew up through the grief of this\\r\\nweighty separation, and the girl was already sufficient for the rôle as\\r\\nguardian of the hearth.\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since he had left she had written each week the letter which he\\r\\nwaited for impatiently and which he read and re-read during the following\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThis morning he seemed more cheerful. It was not only the joy of finding\\r\\nhimself in the open air again, of having finished with the constant\\r\\ndanger of being buried alive, but also because now the bombardment had\\r\\ndied down the officer with the mail would be able to bring to-day the\\r\\nletters which we had not received for six days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child had not failed to write a single time on the promised date and\\r\\nhe knew that back in the rear a letter from his daughter was waiting for\\r\\nhim and would come to-day. This thought made him cheerful.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the relief I went with him into the front line trench. It was riddled\\r\\nwith shell holes. Our barbed wire entanglements were almost destroyed,\\r\\nbut the trench was not entirely ruined, and sandbags quickly put it in\\r\\ngood shape again. An immense heap of bricks and smoking ruins cut off our\\r\\nview in front.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all that was left of a farmhouse called “La Maison Rose.” It had\\r\\nbeen sharply disputed in terrible combats and had passed in succession\\r\\nfrom the enemy into our hands and then from ours to the enemy, to remain\\r\\nfinally between the lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: THE FRONT LINE TRENCH _See page 154_]\\r\\n\\r\\nOur artillery was riddling this pile with shells to prevent the Germans\\r\\nfortifying it and making it a point of support commanding our trenches.\\r\\nBut the mass of ruins stayed there and formed a ridge which, if it was\\r\\nnot dangerous, was at least annoying.\\r\\n\\r\\nSub-Lieutenant Delpos demonstrated to me by means of a periscope the\\r\\nuse they might make of that pile of stones. He was a daring but prudent\\r\\ntactician and went on the principle that everything ought to be used to\\r\\nspare the men’s lives, and that we should not neglect to take advantage\\r\\nof any incident in the terrain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lieutenant, here’s an order.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battalion intelligence officer handed him a paper written in pencil:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Chief of battalion of the company of machine guns. A\\r\\n    reconnaissance of aeroplanes signals that the enemy are\\r\\n    installing gas-throwing or liquid fire machines behind the pile\\r\\n    of stones in front of your lines. Blow it up with several bombs\\r\\n    on the ends to scatter it. Ask for volunteers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“See what I told you. The Germans lose no time in utilizing the\\r\\nadvantages of the terrain. See, behind that pile of stones they are\\r\\ninstalling their gas machines. They think they’re sheltered, but nothing\\r\\nis from our aeroplanes. Oh, the aeroplanes!”\\r\\n\\r\\nA man from the engineers, who have received a similar order, comes with\\r\\nthe explosives. He looks at the emplacement through a loophole, and turns\\r\\nto us whistling and shaking his head:\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Mince!_ That’s not going to be easy. One might be able to manage it at\\r\\nnight, but by day ... that’s going to be a real bird trap.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! What! What’s to stop your sticking your melinite sausage in that\\r\\ndoghouse? Lend me your peephole. I’m going to see how it stands.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Grizard mixing in the conversation; he had already taken the\\r\\ntwo bombs from the engineer’s hands, which he let go with evident\\r\\nsatisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We ought to put one in each end of the buffet. Don’t worry, Lieutenant.\\r\\nThat’s a fine job and will be well done.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizard turns to his companion Marseille who is draining his two litre\\r\\ncanteen without trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, there, you. This will be a fine chance for a ballad. We’re going to\\r\\nplay a trick on our neighbor opposite.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, as Marseille gave his opinion only by a look without letting go\\r\\nthe neck of his canteen:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, leave some until we get back. We’ll be thirsty.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two volunteers got ready for their expedition at once. They each took\\r\\na bomb and put it in their jacket pockets; protected their heads by a\\r\\nshield which they pushed ahead, and climbed up the bank, crawled under\\r\\nthe barbed wire, and disappeared in the shell holes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had covered their heads with muddy canvas. If they remained\\r\\nmotionless, three yards away one could not tell them from the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough periscopes we watched them advance. The lookouts in the enemy\\r\\ntrench had not seen them yet. Not a shot. Absolute quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “doghouse” is thirty yards from our lines. Sliding along carefully\\r\\nas they must, ten minutes are necessary to get there. The time will seem\\r\\nlong; longer for us than for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am sure that while they are giving their whole attention to getting on\\r\\nin their adventurous spirits, entirely ignorant of the first feeling of\\r\\nfear, that they have no other idea in their heads than to play a good\\r\\njoke on the Boches. They are fine jokers! They have never been known to\\r\\ndraw back from what offers, but when their lives are at stake....\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still nothing. Not a shot!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how could the enemy lookouts see them? We ourselves who know their\\r\\ngoal, who follow their trail, lose sight of them momentarily. Brown grass\\r\\nand burned shrubbery covers the ground at that spot; they must be there\\r\\ninside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ten minutes have gone now. Still nothing!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nHave they seen a danger we cannot see as they neared the goal, and have\\r\\nthey burrowed themselves in the ground? Nevertheless, their mission is\\r\\nextremely urgent, and they know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Delpos nervously frets about and stamps his foot,\\r\\n\\r\\n“I ought to have gone myself....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait, there they are.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMarseille and Grizard are coming back; they are only ten feet from the\\r\\ntrench.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut rash to madness, in their absolute unconsciousness of danger now that\\r\\ntheir mission is accomplished, they take no thought of themselves, and\\r\\ninstead of sliding under the barbed wire, as they went, to get into the\\r\\ndugout Grizard stands up and shouts,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let the balloon go up.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same moment, a shower of bullets!\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizard rebounded, twisted himself in a final contortion, and fell on his\\r\\nback while Marseille jumped into the trench shouting to his comrade,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Haven’t you finished playing the man-serpent?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, when he saw that his comrade was absolutely dead, he burst out in\\r\\nwild anger:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nom de Dieu ... Nom de Dieu ... de nom de Dieu.... If that isn’t too\\r\\nbad.... He needn’t stay there, the rascal. I’m going to get him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe explosion came, a frightful one; the bombs had just exploded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To the sap ... to the sap. It’s going to rain stones.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pile of stones is thrown up with tremendous violence. Blocks are\\r\\nthrown into the trench.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smoke blows away and behind the scattered ruins we see two machine\\r\\nguns in position with their gun crews killed beside them, and all their\\r\\nmaterial for fortifications and gas-making apparatus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sub-lieutenant jumps on the parapet,\\r\\n\\r\\n“To the bayonet, forward, enfants, get the tools.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd before the enemy had recovered from his stupefaction, our men are\\r\\non the guns, which they get and bring back in a hurry under a storm of\\r\\nbullets and grenades.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we are back from this sudden attack, we call the roll. Several fail\\r\\nto answer, and among them my friend of the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suffer as though he had been my own brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night, when the storm of fire has ceased, we try to search carefully\\r\\nthrough the darkness of the terrain where our missing men have fallen.\\r\\nGroans tells us that they are there, but in their fever and pain no one\\r\\nanswers our calls.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt daybreak, at the risk of the bullets which still whistle above the\\r\\ntrench, we are able to see them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere he was scarcely twenty yards away, his large eyes open and looking\\r\\ntowards us ... beyond us ... very far. But I know where!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day begins quietly. Doubtless the enemy is meditating a revenge for\\r\\nyesterday’s surprise; not a shot on our side or on the other. It is the\\r\\nsilence after the storm. I begin to hope for a sudden attack which will\\r\\nlet us go out and bring back our wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man brings the letters with our morning coffee. There was one for him\\r\\nand I call and tell him. He answers with a sigh. I guess rather than hear\\r\\nwhat he wants.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Read me the letter, very loud so I can hear it.” And in a voice which I\\r\\nforce myself to make firm and almost joyous, while sobs choke me, I read\\r\\nthis letter:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “My darling Papa:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “You did not expect a letter from me to-day for it’s not my\\r\\n    usual day. I wanted to surprise you. To-morrow is mamma’s\\r\\n    birthday. With the economies I made out of the allowance, I\\r\\n    had my picture taken. I put on for the occasion her beautiful\\r\\n    necklace and pretty red silk blouse which is so becoming to me.\\r\\n    The neighbors already see how much I look like her.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “And that my little souvenir might be still more precious,\\r\\n    I have copied on the back of the picture the song which you\\r\\n    taught me when I was very small so that I could sing it before\\r\\n    mamma’s portrait.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “This song, now that you are no longer here, tells all that\\r\\n    my heart would say to you on this day I long for you, mamma’s\\r\\n    birthday. It has become my evening prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\n        “‘_Oh! si tu savais, loin de foi,_\\r\\n        _Combien les heures sont amères,_\\r\\n        _Pleines d’attristantes chimères,_\\r\\n        _Et comme désert est le toit,_\\r\\n        _Va, j’ai beau remplir par l’étude_\\r\\n        _Et par le travail, tous mes jours,_\\r\\n        _C’est toi que je cherche toujours_\\r\\n        _Tout au fond de ma solitude._’”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, before I finished my reading, his voice continued the song of\\r\\nthe child as he lay there on the point of death. In the hour of death\\r\\nhis grave voice had a celestial accent; the simple song went up like\\r\\na superhuman song, a seraphic song, above men, beyond all things. It\\r\\npenetrated to the bottom of our souls and probed our hearts and brought\\r\\ntears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe barbarians on the other side of the trench, themselves fathers,\\r\\nhusbands, brothers, understand that a father is dying calling to his\\r\\nchild; that a past common to us all lives again in that last agony.\\r\\nAnd their arms rest inert, their guns are lowered, and all the fierce\\r\\nwarriors remain motionless, dreaming, lost in the contemplation of their\\r\\ninner dreams. Alone, their hearts beat and bleed.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly someone shouts an oath from the German trench. A brute\\r\\nblasphemes,\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Halt dein Maul_.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA shot sounds. A bullet puts an end to that beatific agony.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, there was no need of a signal or an order. Tears dried\\r\\nspontaneously; rage bit our lips and lighted our eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a bound, with a single bound, sudden, violent, unanimous, we jumped\\r\\nthe parapet, and without the enemy’s firing a shot in his utter surprise,\\r\\nwe bounded into the German trench. Five minutes later, there was none\\r\\nleft alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nBowing my head over the body of my friend, I placed the picture of his\\r\\nchild on his still moist lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Communique will say:\\r\\n\\r\\n“South of the Somme we took a picket post by surprise, captured two\\r\\nmachine guns and considerable material for making asphyxiating gas. Our\\r\\nlosses are insignificant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the public will think that very simple—a picket post ... two machine\\r\\nguns ... and no losses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\nA NIGHT CONVOY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonel just telephoned the following order:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The echelons of the companies of machine guns will bring, to-night,\\r\\nthirty thousand cartridges to the P. C.[1] of the regiment. This order\\r\\nmust be executed before daylight.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent the afternoon in verifying the belts and making up the war train.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards seven o’clock we went slowly towards the bridge at Froissy, where\\r\\nwe made a long halt until night fell. The sentry refused to let us take\\r\\nthe towpath which would save us some eight miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were his instructions!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears that the noises of the caissons and wagons might wake up the\\r\\nenemy, who would at once bombard the towpath near which were numerous\\r\\nhuts of regiments who were resting.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we crossed the canal, and in order to get to Cappy on our right, we\\r\\nhave to go round by Bray-sur-Somme.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this road has its distractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road is absolutely torn up and it is not five yards wide anywhere, in\\r\\nfact it is an infernal mixture of automobiles, artillery, caissons and\\r\\nbatteries.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one will slow up. They cross over, go around, hang on, shout, bellow,\\r\\ninsult, and get past as best they can. Our mules are obstinate and\\r\\nstubborn and go on their way placidly in the midst of this uproar.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce we lean so far to the right that the hubs of the wheels on the lower\\r\\nside stick in the mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe doubtless go ahead slowly, but we go ahead all the same. The drivers\\r\\nhave to go in front of their beasts. It would be madness for them to stay\\r\\non the seats of the ammunition wagons, and the certain ruin for man and\\r\\nbeast, for exhausted by fatigue, they would fall asleep and get in the\\r\\nway of the enormous meteors which rush by without seeing anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we approach Bray, the crowding is beyond anything one could imagine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is one compact mass of wagons, trucks, caissons, guns, forage wagons,\\r\\nall entangled, mixed up, wedged together, trying to get through a street\\r\\nscarcely wide enough to let two wagons by and where ten insist on going\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we mix with this crowd, we will condemn ourselves to several hours in\\r\\none place without moving. Once in the crush it is impossible to get free\\r\\nand go back.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoudon suggests that we twist around the village. Our wagons have the\\r\\nadvantage of being able to go anywhere. They were made expressly for this\\r\\nwork and have wide wheels and no frames.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe make a passage through a hawthorn hedge with a few blows of the axe\\r\\nand cross the fields in spite of the invectives of the gendarmes who\\r\\npersist in trying to make us circle round in regular order, just as\\r\\nthough we were going around the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here, brave gendarmes, they pass as they can. Guns thunder. Shells are\\r\\nnear, and it is necessary to arrive at the appointed time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Instructions thought out by some officer in the peace and quiet of a\\r\\nfaraway office are all rot. Go on, you’ll find out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: A COMMANDANT’S POST _See page 165_]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are beyond the village an hour later and are on the highway which\\r\\nleads to the bridge at Cappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, things are askew again. We must cross to get over the bridge. We\\r\\ncan’t go around that. So we get into the string of wagons and follow\\r\\ntheir pace. They advance in skips and jumps ... they go ahead ten yards,\\r\\nstop a quarter of an hour, and begin again. One would think he was in the\\r\\nline at the Opéra on the day of a free performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stand about in one spot more than three hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, about midnight we reach the entrance to the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new delay!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to get out of the way to let convoys past which are going in the\\r\\nopposite direction. They are ammunition trucks which make a noise like\\r\\nthunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then, some artillerymen, who do not want to wait and who glory in\\r\\nthe not altogether fortunate reputation of always getting by, no matter\\r\\nwhat’s in the way, dash on to the bridge at a gallop.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s it. Now we’re in a pickle, a mess ... that’s the....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poles run into the carburetors, the horses rear and kick against the\\r\\nhoods with their maddened hoofs; the motors continue to run, raging at\\r\\ntheir impotence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless a way must be cleared through the bridge. And in the pitch\\r\\ndark night that’s not easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA chauffeur has the ingenious idea of lighting a headlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately, evidently judging that this light is without a doubt\\r\\ninsufficient and its aid is indispensable for us, the German artillery\\r\\nsends us all the material necessary for clearing the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt sends us shells and with absolutely no care at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the right, to the left, in front, and behind, the shots fall like a\\r\\nhailstorm.\\r\\n\\r\\nCries, groans, oaths, and commands impossible to execute! It is Hell.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an excess of generosity, doubtless to aid us in getting out of our\\r\\ndifficulty, a well-aimed shell falls on a truck, sets fire to the\\r\\ngasoline tank, and the whole thing saturated with paint and covered with\\r\\nimpervious canvas bursts into flames.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can see. We can see only too well now, and the Boches too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough their glasses they can easily estimate what their objective is\\r\\nworth and see what a large crowd is crowding around the spectacle. And\\r\\ntheir bombardment doubles in intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is no time to stay here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the trot we gain the fields and follow the bank lined by poplars.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reach the limit of the zone of fire in about three hundred yards. We\\r\\ncrowd behind the trees and hedges to avoid the splinters which can still\\r\\nreach us.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, there is a terrible cry, a noise of something falling. The\\r\\nbridge has fallen down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is fatal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve got to be at the P. C. at daybreak, but I don’t see how we are\\r\\ngoing to make it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is absolutely nothing to do just now; it would be folly to try\\r\\nanything, no matter what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo matter what the cost these convoys must reach the left bank, where\\r\\nnumerous units wait for the ammunition which they need badly, so the\\r\\norder is given to silence the enemy’s batteries which are bombarding us\\r\\nso thoroughly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the guns in the valley of Froissy, including the big English guns,\\r\\nthunder out at once in an astounding uproar....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy returns the fire with a storm of shrapnel. But the trees with\\r\\ntheir thick leaves fortunately protect us from this. We hear splinters\\r\\nand bullets falling into the waters of the canal a few yards away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire near the bridge continues. The flames have reached other\\r\\nvehicles now and a great cloud goes up in the air lighting up the\\r\\nsurrounding country. No one even dares to think of trying to put it out\\r\\nin the thick rain of bullet and shell.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoudon is disturbed. He is a man of duty, to whom an order is a sacred\\r\\nthing. No obstacle should prevent the execution of an order, so he\\r\\nproposes that we go back to Froissy and reach the P. C. of the regiment\\r\\nby way of the Cappy plateau.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s mad, _mon vieux_. We’d never make it before nine o’clock in the\\r\\nmorning, and we’d all be killed going that way in the open.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So much the worse. It is necessary to bring the ammunition. It is an\\r\\norder and it is urgent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait a little while until this quiets down. They’ll not go on like this\\r\\nall night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they will too; they’ve seen the convoys and they’ll keep up the\\r\\nbarrage until daylight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If we could only find a boat. We could take the caissons to the other\\r\\nside. The quarry isn’t far from there. The men could carry them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you thinking about? Going to find a boat at this time of\\r\\nnight! And with what is falling into the canal we’d run some risk in\\r\\ncrossing....”\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nFar from silencing the enemy, the fire of our batteries exasperates him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeavy guns, guns on tractors doubtless, have been brought into play.\\r\\n“280’s” and “210’s” come at regular intervals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boches must have thought they had surprised a strategic movement much\\r\\nmore important than it really was and were trying to check it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place is becoming untenable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the edge of the canal is a large stable for the canal horses, and\\r\\na crowd of drivers, gunners, and cyclists have taken refuge there. It\\r\\nfalls apart when a great shell strikes it. A terrible cry goes up and the\\r\\nbuilding bursts into flames all over, like tow soaked in oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one knows how many bodies are burned to cinders there. A frightful\\r\\nodor assails our nostrils in the smoke which encircles us.\\r\\n\\r\\nA heavy rolling roar, boring through the night like the noise of an\\r\\nexpress train coming out of a tunnel at high speed, comes from over\\r\\nthere, from the black hole where the enemy is.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s a terrific fire!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look out.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA violent puff, like a heavy blow, knocks us down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mules rear and draw back. A wagon slides down the bank and falls into\\r\\nthe water, taking its animal and driver with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shell has burst on the bank opposite and it has torn up by the roots a\\r\\nlarge poplar which falls across the canal. It is a miracle that it didn’t\\r\\ncrush a dozen of us. We run to help the driver. The water is shallow. He\\r\\nholds himself up by the weeds. We pull him out with the aid of several\\r\\nlengths of whip lash, but the mule and the wagon have rolled into the\\r\\nmiddle of the canal and are lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bombardment continues until dawn, but less violently.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few shots, the longest, come near us. The pounding continues on the\\r\\nsite of the bridge, obstinately and stubbornly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are still there at the first rays of dawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is exasperating. We can never get these munitions to the P. C.\\r\\nbefore daylight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say, Roudon, we have a bridge right in front of us. It will do.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd indeed the large poplar might let us get across the canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe try it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe leave one man to guard the five wagons, and the rest detach the\\r\\ncaissons from their supports, hang them on our shoulders, and one after\\r\\nanother we try the chance bridge which bends a little but does not break.\\r\\n\\r\\nLess than fifteen minutes later all the munitions are together on the\\r\\nopposite bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reached the P. C. at five o’clock, exhausted without a doubt, but the\\r\\norder has been executed.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the artillery officer saw us arriving, he started shouting,\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you want me to do with that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRoudon repeated the order he had received the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you haven’t received the cancellation of the order? You always ought\\r\\nto wait for that. We were relieved last night. Take that stuff back where\\r\\nyou got it from.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe carried the caissons back to our wagons by the same way, by the same\\r\\nbridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain D ... was coming along the towpath and saw us arrive.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoudon was furious as he told him about our useless adventure which might\\r\\nhave cost us so dear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened, laughed, then, coldly:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bah! that will do the mules good. They’ll get used to marching at\\r\\nnight....”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SONGS OF THE HOMELAND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFontaine-les-Cappy is some hundred yards from the lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a reserve position to which the company was sent the day before in\\r\\nexpectation of an attack which may come at any moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is raining as it hasn’t stopped raining for weeks. We had floundered\\r\\nin the mud for five hours and were splashed by an endless string of\\r\\nconvoys to get here from Villers where the regiment had scarcely begun a\\r\\nfew short days of rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men were tired out and threw themselves on the filthy straw. They\\r\\nhave slept nearly all day, and this evening in groups they try their\\r\\nhardest to organize a respectable meal from the means at their disposal.\\r\\nThe wine flows from full canteens, and flasks of cheap brandy come out of\\r\\nthe packs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe section leaders advise them to save some of their provisions for the\\r\\nnext day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow! What do you think? To-morrow we’ll lunch with the Boches.\\r\\nYou! I’ll pay you in sauerkraut.”\\r\\n\\r\\nConversation gradually grew less amid the falling darkness and the smoke\\r\\nof pipes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe silence became profound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men are not sleeping. They think and remember. Sadness and worry\\r\\nhover about....\\r\\n\\r\\nFar away, hesitating, a voice sings a prelude. But that voice is so\\r\\npure and clear that it seems enormous, startling, vibrating in the dull\\r\\nnumbness of men and things.\\r\\n\\r\\nVigne is humming a song of Provence, a hymn to the sun, which from the\\r\\nbanks of the Durance to the shores of the Latin sea, from the blue hills\\r\\nof the Alps to the golden flowers of Vacarès, the youths and maidens of\\r\\nAvignon, Arles, and Maillamne sing as they return to the hospitable farm\\r\\nfrom their labors, their hands entwined for the farandole, with eyes full\\r\\nof smiles and love for the bright sun which makes them live and love.\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Grand souleù de la Provènço_\\r\\n    _Gai coumpaire doù mistrau_\\r\\n    _Tu qu’escoules la Durènço_\\r\\n    _Comme un flot de vin de Crau,_\\r\\n    _Fai lusi toun blound caleù!_\\r\\n    _Coucho l’oumbro emai li fleù!_\\r\\n        _Leù! leù! leù!_\\r\\n    _Fai te vèire, beù souleù!_\\r\\n\\r\\nVigne was sitting in a corner, elbows on his knees, chin between his\\r\\nhands, his face lifted, and singing unconsciously, his eyes on the\\r\\ndistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nA candle stuck in the neck of a bottle throws a flickering light on the\\r\\ndamp ground of the cellar, and scarcely separates his outlines from the\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nGradually one follows in, one after another, naturally, and they all\\r\\nbegin to sing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd music and rhythm form so large a part of their natures that they form\\r\\na wonderful choir where the thirds and minors take form instinctively\\r\\nwithout an effort, and where the dream of their homeland marks the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they sing from their souls, and through it all is the sun of their\\r\\nbeautiful South, the poetry of their dawns, the charm of their twilights,\\r\\nthe mystic gleams of the olives, the flight of the red flamingoes on the\\r\\npools, the coming down of the shepherds from the perfumed hills, the mad\\r\\ncareer of the bulls in clouds of dust on the white roads of Camargue, the\\r\\ngold of the mimosas, the red of the wild poppies, the blue sky, the blue\\r\\nsea, the sun....\\r\\n\\r\\n        _Fai lusi...._\\r\\n    _Fai lusi toun blound caleù._\\r\\n\\r\\nThese soft voices, monotonous, hesitating a moment ago, which seemed\\r\\nscarcely awake, now sound out, vibrant, dashing, sonorous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are no longer uprooted exiles who are stirred; it is a force, a\\r\\ncrowd, a people whom the song of their birthplace awakes, draws together,\\r\\ncheers. It is Provence herself that sings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside, the cannon roar and the shells fall like hail around the\\r\\ncantonment. Great shells tear up the ground with their gigantic blows.\\r\\n\\r\\nWar, horrors, blood, ruins, fear, the attack which is near at hand, death\\r\\nperhaps, all that exists no longer for them. It is all of no consequence\\r\\nto them; the air of their natal song transports them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese men shut up in dark cellars, in dugouts, shaken by the terrific\\r\\nhammering of shells, are transported by their dream to the bright\\r\\nsunshine, the bright and cheerful atmosphere of their southern plains.\\r\\nThey sing, and at once they are living again the life of their homeland.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir “little” country dominates them and makes them valiant and strong\\r\\nin the midst of the sorrows all about to attack and stand up in defense\\r\\nof the Great!...\\r\\n\\r\\nI go out with my nerves on edge and my eyes full of tears before the\\r\\nunearthly beauty of the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nStreaks of light from the stuffed air-holes alone let me realize that men\\r\\nin large numbers wait there underground for a signal to dash into the\\r\\nfiery furnace....\\r\\n\\r\\nI walk to the end of the village to the officers’ quarters to calm my\\r\\nnerves.\\r\\n\\r\\nVoices still rise in song on both sides of the road. There, under my feet\\r\\nin a ruin—so martyred that one might think it was an acropolis raising\\r\\nprayers of stone to heaven—a chorus of warm voices scans the joyous song,\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Qué cantès, qué recantès_\\r\\n        _Cantès pas per iev,_\\r\\n        _Cantès per ma mia_\\r\\n        _Qu’es auprès de iev._\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the lads of Languedoc, Nîmes, Montpellier, the vine growers of\\r\\nthe plains, the carters of Aiguesmortes, the harvesters of Toulouse all\\r\\ncarried away by the evocation of their homeland.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! the beautiful song! How it puts heart into one; more beautiful than\\r\\nthe most martial hymn composed in the harsh technique of the ink pots.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the living expression, simple, spontaneous, natural, of the\\r\\npeople, the family and the soil. It carries in it the remembrances of\\r\\nhappy childhood, of loves bathed in sunshine, the radiant nuptials in\\r\\nthe mystery of light and flowers. It speaks of the loved pastures, the\\r\\npaternal roof, the farm, the herds, the vines ... and that is the Patrie.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! the beautiful song! It dissipates dark thoughts, fears,\\r\\nuncertainties; it makes lovers and heroes, electrifies them, and\\r\\nincreases their strength a hundred fold. They are the lads of Provence\\r\\nand Languedoc who spread through the world the triumphal “Marseillaise.”\\r\\nThey are the same lads who despite the mud and the dark night breathe in\\r\\ntheir memory and in the song the re-vivifying breath of their “little”\\r\\ncountry, who in pursuit of the routed enemy make the “Marseillaise”\\r\\nvictorious again, victorious alway.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the village in a house at the side of the road to\\r\\nChuignolles, a feeble light filters through the canvas which takes the\\r\\nplace of shutters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officers are quartered here. Lieutenant Casanova is stretched out\\r\\non a mattress on the ground, smoking and dreaming over his eternal\\r\\ncigarette. Lieutenant Delpos leaning on a box which serves him for a\\r\\ntable, is reading, by the light of a lantern, an illustrated novel.\\r\\n\\r\\nI look over his shoulder. They are rather sprightly, suggestive\\r\\nillustrations, reinforced with a vengeance by the fervid imagination and\\r\\nsecond-hand talent of the readers who have handed it around.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind and rain rage outside the window. Poor weather for an attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sure that we’ve come here for nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that can be launched at any time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should be much surprised if it came this evening.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA heavy, faraway, continuous rumble, like the beating of a drum, is heard\\r\\njust then.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound seems to come from the direction of Lihons and to get nearer by\\r\\ndegrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of the fusillade we hear distinctly the regular crackle of\\r\\nthe machine guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, a terrific fire breaks out opposite us. D ... company, which we\\r\\nare to support, must have gone into action.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s getting close.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe go out. The road forms a sort of embankment at this spot, which is\\r\\nforbidden during the daytime, and from which we look toward the lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great light has risen. More and more frequent bursts of shrapnel at\\r\\nthis distance have the effect of immense red Venetian lanterns, tossed\\r\\nabout by the wind in the dark night.\\r\\n\\r\\nRockets go up suddenly on our right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is a call for the artillery. The expected attack is probably taking\\r\\nplace over there. We have been placed in reserve for fear that the attack\\r\\nmight widen out on the sector, but it is probable that we shall not have\\r\\nto intervene.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It looks as though it were quieting down there in front.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hum! You’ll see.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Casanova has had great experience in battles, and he isn’t\\r\\ntaken by surprise by apparent lulls. On the contrary. Silence is what he\\r\\ndreads most.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll see.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as a matter of fact we didn’t have long to wait.... A tornado of\\r\\nshells falls between the lines and our cantonment. This is immediately\\r\\nfollowed by another, then still another, all in a couple of minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a barrage of “77’s,” effected by a battery which has taken us in\\r\\nits fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I certainly think that something is going to happen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go and tell the section leaders to get their men together and to have\\r\\nthem ready.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI go into the night in search of the cantonment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the men are awake. The corporals and sergeants have foreseen the\\r\\norder and everyone is waiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shells and the fire of our rifles and our machine guns is only one\\r\\nfrightful uproar in which all noises are confounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I return toward the officers badly aimed spent machine-gun bullets\\r\\nwhistle in the trees above.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All we can do is to wait. If they need us, they’ll call us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he said this the ever-imperturbable Lieutenant Casanova went back into\\r\\nhis quarters and we followed him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suggest poker,” said Delpos. “I’ll go and find the cards.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Three-handed poker is too risky.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, here’s a fourth.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone raised the canvas which served as a door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s an intelligence officer from the colonel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lieutenant, D ... company is running out of munitions. Pass yours to\\r\\nthem and send back for new supplies. Here’s the order.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant read the order and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right. It will be done.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHardly twenty minutes later, ten men from each section, each carrying\\r\\nfour caissons, were assembled on the way out of the village.\\r\\n\\r\\nD ... company’s position, which we marked yesterday, is about six hundred\\r\\nyards away and some yards beyond the ridge of the plateau between the\\r\\nmain road from Amiens and the Somme. There’s little chance of losing the\\r\\nway, for it is downhill. We might pass through the fields but thirty\\r\\nyards before reaching the trench the ground is literally swept with\\r\\nshells. It is impossible to use the communication trench. The enemy\\r\\nartillery has located it mathematically and has completely destroyed it.\\r\\nThe shells fall there without a let-up. The least dangerous passage is\\r\\nthe unprotected ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nStretched out in the mud, the head of one against the heels of the other,\\r\\nour men form an endless chain on the terrain which extends from the\\r\\nsheltered ridge to the fire trench. They pass along the caissons by a\\r\\nsimple movement of the arms, without raising their bodies or their heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same way and by the same means, crawling along, I reach the\\r\\ntrenches in my turn and fall in.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain D ... is there, striding from one gun to another, encouraging his\\r\\nmen and hurrying their fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was sure that I was going to run out of ammunition. They were already\\r\\nwithin one hundred and fifty yards.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve passed you one hundred and sixty caissons. We’ve sent men for more\\r\\nand they’ll be here in half an hour.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We don’t need any more. It’s all over. Their attempt is broken. By\\r\\ndaylight we’ll see more than two hundred bodies in front of our barbed\\r\\nwire. You can go. I thank you. Take my regards and thanks to Lieutenant\\r\\nCasanova.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe firing continued all night, sometimes intermittently, sometimes in\\r\\nviolent salvos, so that one might imagine that the enemy was making\\r\\nanother attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt dawn we only heard rare, isolated detonations.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nOur men returned to the cantonment uninjured. There were a few scratches\\r\\nand slight wounds in the hands, but there was no discharge in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of them had had narrow escapes. Bullets had ricochetted and gone\\r\\nthrough the steel helmets. Linari’s was perforated with a round,\\r\\nwell-defined hole. The bullet had gone out close to the ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: THE LEAST DANGEROUS PASSAGE IS THE UNPROTECTED GROUND _See\\r\\npage 185_]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were exhausted by lack of sleep, and after eating a meal hastily\\r\\nthrown together from the things at hand, they started for their\\r\\nunderground shelters.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then the sun rose shining brightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the sky, washed by weeks of rain, it was so clear and smiling with\\r\\nwarmth that one would have thought it was a sunrise in the South.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say, this morning that’s the sun of the South!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s it doing here? It’s made a mistake.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beautiful sun! Indeed, there’s only you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the pure morning air, these peasants of Provence saluted the\\r\\nrising sun by shouting the joyous song which, a few hours before, had\\r\\nbrightened their night.\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Gran souleù de la Prouvènço_\\r\\n    _Fai lusi toun blound caleù._\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attack was heavy; it is over. They have come back from it. They are\\r\\nstill alive. We must begin all over again, to-night, perhaps; possibly\\r\\nthis evening; perhaps in an hour. Death lurks everywhere. What difference\\r\\ndoes it make? This morning the sun rose radiantly. They sing!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\nA WATER PATROL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several days the Germans had been at work making changes opposite\\r\\nour salient on the banks of the Somme. Probably it was a machine-gun\\r\\nemplacement to prevent any attempt at attack from that side. But as there\\r\\nmust be no obstacle in the way of our next advance, the major, after\\r\\ntalking with the colonel, sent for Lieutenant Delpos, who was in charge\\r\\nof the section in that sector and asked him what he thought of the work.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s hard to say,” he answered. “If they’ve brought two or three machine\\r\\nguns it will be humanly impossible even to try to advance. It all depends\\r\\non the importance of the work. We can’t tell from here what it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Our aeroplane observations and photographs don’t tell us anything,” said\\r\\nthe major. “The view is partly cut off by the tops of the trees along the\\r\\nriver.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aeroplane observations aren’t everything,” answered Delpos.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I can’t send a patrol over such unprotected ground. It would be\\r\\nutterly wiped out before it discovered anything.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you give me an order,” asked Delpos, “to make a reconnaissance in\\r\\nwhatever way I think best? In twenty-four hours, at the latest, I think I\\r\\ncan bring you the exact details.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go ahead. Do your best. I’ll send you a written order to cover it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he got back to his post, Lieutenant Delpos examined the strip of\\r\\nterrain as thoroughly as he could by peering over the top of the parapet,\\r\\nand then asked for the photographs the aeroplanes had taken. Finally,\\r\\nhe studied the map of the country which the enemy occupied opposite us.\\r\\nThen, he went to Éclusier, borrowed a boat, and stayed out in the current\\r\\ncalculating its direction by bunches of grass pulled from the banks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came back to the company towards noon and sent me to the echelon for\\r\\nGondran, whom I brought back about three o’clock. At seven Delpos had\\r\\nhis plans made. He went to the major, who received him at once, and\\r\\nexplained the project he wanted to put into execution that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nDelpos asked him, as it would probably be useful in distracting\\r\\nattention, to have the sections at the extreme north of the sector fire\\r\\nseveral heavy volleys between eleven o’clock and midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this was arranged, everything was ready for his departure and he\\r\\ninvited me to dinner as he ordinarily did. His dinners were always good\\r\\nand there was excellent wine which his servant had managed to find in the\\r\\nruins of Harbonnière and Villers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was lighting his cigar after the dessert, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re going to pay a call on the Boches this evening. The chances of\\r\\nstaying there are about even, but, in any case, even if we remain, the\\r\\nperformance won’t be uninteresting. It will be as good as a first night\\r\\nat the ‘Grand-Guignol!’ Take your revolver, some grenades and come along.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI would have been highly unappreciative to have refused such a kind\\r\\ninvitation, although adventure, to say nothing of such a mad adventure,\\r\\nhas never been to my taste. But Lieutenant Delpos had the reputation of\\r\\nalways getting out, so why shouldn’t he get out this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nGondran was waiting for us a little ways from Éclusier, in a small creek,\\r\\nhidden under the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nGondran and his boat!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was one of those flat-bottomed, square-ended boats that fishermen\\r\\nuse to cross marshes where the water is shallow. He had covered it with\\r\\na camouflage of grass, weeds, and moss so that even close to it was\\r\\nimpossible to tell it from one of the thousand little islands which\\r\\nobstruct the Somme at this point.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe slipped into the boat and stretched out at once—it wouldn’t have held\\r\\nus in any other way—and waited for total darkness. When it came, Gondran\\r\\nbegan to push the boat ahead. He was used to fishing for eels with a\\r\\nspear in the clear waters of the canals and knew how to move silently,\\r\\nwithout a splash, almost without making a ripple on the surface of the\\r\\nwater. If our course had not been against the current, we might have been\\r\\nmistaken for a pile of drifting grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlat on his stomach in the stern with both arms in the water up to his\\r\\nelbows and a stick of wood in each hand, slowly and silently he paddled\\r\\nlike a duck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer and I were both flat also, in the bow, and we peered into the\\r\\ndarkness. I held a string in one hand, and the other end was tied around\\r\\nGondran’s arm. We had arranged that one pull meant to stop and stay where\\r\\nwe were; two to go back.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went on without accident for nearly two hours. Suddenly, a bump, a\\r\\nhard jolt, fortunately without any noise besides the rustling of the\\r\\nweeds. The night was so thick that it was impossible to tell what the\\r\\nobstacle was, whether it was the bank or an island. We tried in vain\\r\\nto see through the fathomless darkness. We ventured to feel about with\\r\\nour hands, and, in the middle of the weeds and reeds, I was gripped by\\r\\nsomething. I pulled back my arm, in a hurry, to get away. A sharp point\\r\\ncut the skin, then another, and I felt a scratch from my elbow to my fist.\\r\\n\\r\\nI whispered in Delpos’s ear, “Barbed wire.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA network of barbed wire barred the river here. The Germans had foreseen\\r\\nthe possibilities of an approach and had taken precautions to prevent\\r\\nit. Was the network large, or was there only a single barrier, that was\\r\\nthe question. Or, should we go back? In any case there was no use in\\r\\nre-appearing before we were expected, for we had reached their lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the work under suspicion was a little in advance of their first\\r\\ntrench, we must be nearly even with it. We had brought wire cutters, but\\r\\nwhat was the use of cutting the first net, if we were to find another\\r\\nbeyond it, and then another, and so on for fifty or a hundred yards\\r\\nperhaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy is meticulous in his defenses and spares no means of protecting\\r\\nhimself. It was also a question whether we were in the middle of the\\r\\nriver or near the bank. By shoving his paddle down at arm’s length\\r\\nGondran touched bottom. So we were going to reach the bank, but first we\\r\\nmust prepare for our retreat. Using the barbed wire as a guide, we put\\r\\nthe boat out into the middle of the river, but not in the strength of the\\r\\ncurrent, and then on a stick we had brought along set up a dummy dressed\\r\\nin the uniform of one of the Colonials. Then we went back to the bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was the most ticklish and dangerous moment of our mission. What, we\\r\\nasked ourselves, was the shape of the bank and would we find a sentinel?\\r\\nWe brought the boat as near the shore as possible and in as far as we\\r\\ncould. By feeling to the right we could touch solid ground. The time had\\r\\ncome!... We glided from the boat like snakes and once on land remained\\r\\nmotionless, holding our breaths. It was impossible to see anything a yard\\r\\noff; there was no noise except the far-off rumbling of the guns in the\\r\\nEnglish sector. We went ahead.... The heavy socks we had drawn over our\\r\\nboots deadened our steps. The damp grass bent but did not crackle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Conrad! Come here. It is time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What time?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nearly midnight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The lieutenant isn’t here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is with the major and will come back.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come along.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But there’s no one here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What of it? Come along.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis conversation in German stopped us short. The voices seemed to come\\r\\nfrom the ground two steps in front of us. Doubtless there was a sap\\r\\nthere.... We heard steps getting farther away. I grabbed the officer\\r\\nand making a megaphone of my hands whispered in his ear what I had just\\r\\nunderstood from their conversation. In the same way, he responded:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Inviting you was an inspiration. Since they’ve gone, we can get in\\r\\nthere.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA few steps beyond in the open ground a feeble light filtered through\\r\\nsacks hung as shutters. It was the sap!... We stretched out on the ground\\r\\nand tried to see inside. There was no one standing, but if anyone was\\r\\nleft he must be asleep, and we could surprise him.... We jumped in. Not a\\r\\nsoul. Without a doubt it was a post momentarily empty during a relief. On\\r\\nsome overturned chairs there was a platter with a candle on it and we put\\r\\nit out. We examined the place with our flashlight. A communication trench\\r\\nopened into the post and we started down.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo matter where it led or whether we could retrace our steps or not,\\r\\nthe die was cast. The number of chances of our getting back alive which\\r\\nDelpos had said were even seemed to me to have grown beautifully less.\\r\\nThe trench stopped short within ten yards. Ahead, to the right, to the\\r\\nleft, we stuck our noses into the solid wall. But the men had got out\\r\\nsomeway....\\r\\n\\r\\nDelpos risked another flash of his light—the way out was over our heads.\\r\\nIt was a shaft with a ladder leading up it. We heard someone talking\\r\\nabove. The relief was coming down....\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then the noise of firing came from our own lines. The sections were\\r\\nfiring as had been arranged. This wise precaution served beyond our\\r\\nutmost expectations, for above us began at once the rapid tac-tac of the\\r\\nmachine guns and we heard commands.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the shaft led into the machine-gun emplacement. That was just what we\\r\\nwanted to know; our reconnaissance was at an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nDelpos drove a cheddite bomb into the wall beneath the ladder, and I tied\\r\\na slow fuse to it. We jumped towards the river. I lighted the fuse as I\\r\\njumped from the sap, just as an immense body appeared in the opening and\\r\\nblocked the way.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Wer da?_”\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘_Wer da?_’ you’ll find out who is there,” Delpos muttered, and with a\\r\\nblow full on the chest, while I threw myself on his legs, we got the\\r\\ncolossus down, as he shouted for help.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the firing drowned his cries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, to deprive him of all interest in keeping on, I applied my revolver\\r\\nto his forehead, and Delpos kicked him under the chin. We left him\\r\\nsenseless and voiceless for at least a quarter of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe jumped into our boat and slid under the camouflage. Whether we had\\r\\nmade too much noise or a sentinel had heard us, I don’t know, but we\\r\\nwere hardly there, and were just pushing off, when shots came in our\\r\\ndirection, star shells lighted the river, and men ran up and down the\\r\\nbank.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe heard them cry, “There he is ... there....” They had seen our dummy in\\r\\nthe middle of the river and were firing at him with rifles and bombarding\\r\\nhim with grenades. We did not move. By stretching out an arm we could\\r\\nalmost have touched the legs of the men who came down to the water’s edge\\r\\nto hurl their grenades. None of them dreamed we were so near.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alarm lasted about twenty seconds; it seemed like a century.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe knew that the blockhouse was going to blow up and we wanted to be far\\r\\naway for the débris were likely to reach us and crush us.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, terribly, came the explosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was fortunate for us that the alarm had held us close to the bank.\\r\\nWhole blocks of granite were hurled into the middle of the river just\\r\\nwhere we would have been. We were too near and too low and everything\\r\\nwent over us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe violence of the waves tore us from the bank and drove us into the\\r\\nstrength of the current, and we weren’t fired on once. The whole garrison\\r\\nhad been blown up.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAt daybreak, three o’clock in the morning, Lieutenant Delpos woke up the\\r\\nmajor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Major,” he said, “it was a machine-gun emplacement. But it is no more.\\r\\nIf you will allow me, I’m going to bed. I couldn’t get any sleep over\\r\\nthere; there was too much noise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\nA COMMANDER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of June, the colonel’s report informed us that the major\\r\\nof Battalion C ... had been assigned to the ... first Colonials.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battalion commandant’s post was next to ours on the ridge of the\\r\\nquarry.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the departure of Major L ... the captain adjutant-major, who was\\r\\nassuming the command in the interim, was quartered there. He was devoting\\r\\nhimself to his ablutions in the open place in front of his dugout and\\r\\nat the same time telling Lieutenants C ... and D ..., his neighbors,\\r\\nan uproarious adventure of his last leave, when a man, tall and spare,\\r\\nwith hollowed cheeks, sunburned skin, eyes deep and shining, modestly\\r\\ndressed,—a mechanic’s blue trousers, badly fitting and muddy boots,\\r\\nregulation trooper’s jacket, with no mark to show his rank,—came out of\\r\\nthe sort of tunnel in which the La Vache trench ended, and stopped as if\\r\\nundecided, in front of our dugouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a mounted scout there who was occupying himself in cutting out\\r\\na ring, and he asked him,\\r\\n\\r\\n“The post of the major of the ... first battalion?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout stopping his work, the man indicated our group with his hand. He\\r\\nadvanced shyly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The ... first battalion?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is it,” said the adjutant-major, drawing his wet head from the\\r\\ncanvas bucket in which he was plunging.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am Major C....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Major, I beg your pardon. I didn’t know....” mopping his face\\r\\nrapidly, and putting on his tunic which his orderly handed to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a word, the unperturbed figure, Major C ..., looked off into the\\r\\ndistance, beyond material things, waited for him to finish his toilet,\\r\\nand then entered into the P. C. to take possession of his new post.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of us who lived constantly in his immediate neighborhood ever knew\\r\\nany other expression on his firm, cold, almost mystical face. His hair\\r\\nwas poorly cut, his beard was thin and long, and his voice was gentle,\\r\\nvery gentle, so gentle that one might call it a sad sing-song. All in all\\r\\nhe had none of the outward appearance of the conventional commander.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless he was one of the best.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nGood reputations, they say, take longest to establish. Only legends come\\r\\nto life spontaneously. His kindliness and honesty must have belonged to\\r\\nthe legends, because in less than a week there was not a single man in\\r\\nthe battalion who did not speak of him with respect and admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s a chic type,” they said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s a man.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the men, who love to see their commander among them, living their\\r\\nlife, sharing their labors and fatigue, experiencing the same trials,\\r\\nknew at once that he did not belong to that distant and unknown hierarchy\\r\\nwhich transmits its orders from an ivory throne.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the day he took over his command, he wanted to see everything for\\r\\nhimself and all the positions in the sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his knotty baton in his hand, he went through all the communication\\r\\ntrenches, the first-line trenches, into the saps, verified the riflemen’s\\r\\nposts, and, it was said, spent nights in the picket posts.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the battalion relieved the 38th at Méharicourt, the commandant’s\\r\\npost which was assigned to the major was in an immense house in the\\r\\nmiddle of a park which was not much destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the day before, however, the artillery had established an\\r\\nobservation tower in a poplar and had foreseen that it would hardly be\\r\\nprudent to occupy the house. It would be shelled if the battery were\\r\\nspotted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commander learned this, and without saying a word established his\\r\\nthings all the same in the salon which he used for an office and bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first night and the next morning passed without incident—not a single\\r\\nshot from the Boche lines. Aeroplanes flew over at daybreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had invited to lunch, as was his custom, when we were in cantonment,\\r\\nthe doctor, his captain adjutant-major, and the engineer officer in\\r\\ncharge of the sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy relations with him dated back before the war, so I was with him often,\\r\\nand he frequently kept me at the table with his guests. I was there that\\r\\nday.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had scarcely sat down when they began to talk of Portugal’s entrance\\r\\ninto the war. The engineer was the manager of a political paper and his\\r\\nremarks were so keen that we were all interested, and even the servants\\r\\nstopped to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then a shell, the first in two days, burst somewhere in the\\r\\nneighborhood. The glasses rattled on the table; we could hear things\\r\\nfalling, and people running by in the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major, who had been as silent as usual during the meal, spoke up in\\r\\nhis quiet voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n“They say that their artillery is excellent ... it comes from\\r\\nCreusit”—and he engaged the journalist in a historical discussion about\\r\\nthe armament and strength of Portugal, which showed a deep knowledge of\\r\\nthe country, in spite of its unexpected and recent entrance into the\\r\\nranks of the Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journalist seemed to take a lively interest in this conversation\\r\\nwhich he had started, but he instinctively turned his eyes to the windows\\r\\nevery time a shell burst, for now explosions far and near, the screeching\\r\\nof shells and the falling of walls indicated clearly that we were the\\r\\ncenter of a bombardment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt each explosion the doctor looked at the adjutant-major, who kept on\\r\\neating quietly, as if to say, “Are you going to stay here much longer?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe explosions came nearer and all around us. We could see plainly the\\r\\nbits of steel which whistled by the windows, grazing the walls which they\\r\\ndestroyed. We could hear the plaster falling down the staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the servant brought the desserts—a Camembert, crackers, fruit,\\r\\nand white wine—a violent explosion of a new arrival nearby tore the\\r\\nwindow, stuffed with paper, from its hinges and the draught of air half\\r\\noverturned the orderly who let the platter fall on the table, to the\\r\\ngreat damage of the tablecloth where the white wine ran out....\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Bigre!_” said the major.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think it’s time to get into the cellar.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineer was only waiting for this invitation to stop the\\r\\nconversation and was half out of his chair when the major took his arm\\r\\nand sat him down again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In short, Portugal owed its title of Historical Conquistador to its\\r\\nnavy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he began to relate the records of that valorous nation on the sea\\r\\nfrom the time these people on the Tagus served in the Carthaginian\\r\\ntriremes to Vasco da Gama, Magellan, Cabral, Bartholomew Diaz. Never was\\r\\nconversation more polished, imaginative, and undisturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA terrific explosion shook the house; part of the roof rolled down the\\r\\nstaircase; the cook and the waiter jumped into the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Major, it fell in the garden, ten feet from the kitchen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The gentlemen are waiting for their coffee. Bring it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor could stand no more, alleged that perhaps there were wounded\\r\\nwaiting for him at the dressing station, and asked permission to\\r\\nwithdraw.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servants brought in the boiling coffee in a hurry, and he got up to\\r\\ngo, as the commander said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ll go along with you. We’ll see whether the shells have done much\\r\\ndamage in the cantonment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, Commander, do you think it’s prudent to venture out in the streets\\r\\njust now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s my opinion, gentlemen, that the Germans, who obviously wanted to\\r\\nfurnish the music for our meal, should know that we’ve finished”—and he\\r\\nlighted his cigar and went out on the steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood was badly shattered indeed. Large holes blocked the\\r\\nstreet; the artillery observatory had been hit by a well-aimed shell, had\\r\\nfallen on a shed and crushed it. Immense craters had appeared here and\\r\\nthere in the garden and the whole front of the house was splashed with\\r\\nsteel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy’s fire was letting up; it had almost ceased.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeads now appeared at the air-holes of the cellars trying to see what had\\r\\nhappened.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe followed the commander along the main street which led to the\\r\\ndressing post. An aeroplane in the azure sky, a small silver bird shining\\r\\nin the sun, went on its giddy way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith our noses in the air, we watched it pass. The whistle of a shell\\r\\napproached with a noise like a panting locomotive.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s the last.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA frightful crash, a cloud of greenish smoke, bricks and timbers fall ...\\r\\ncries....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe villa we had just left re-appeared with a large yawning hole, its\\r\\nwalls burning and fallen apart. The last shell had fallen into the dining\\r\\nroom!\\r\\n\\r\\nHis courage and coolness were not calculated or put on; they were not an\\r\\neffort of the will. They were natural.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a fatalist like all who have lived long in Eastern countries.\\r\\nWhat he had above all was a powerful control of himself and a sovereign\\r\\ncontempt for danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had an absolutely definite conviction that he would be killed in the\\r\\nnext attack. He had so thoroughly accustomed himself to the idea that as\\r\\na result he had made all arrangements and now awaited the hour, in the\\r\\nmeanwhile doing his duty as a commander honorably and simply.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening I went to greet him at his cantonment at Froissy—he was going\\r\\non leave the next day—I asked him, among other things, if it would be\\r\\nagreeable to him, if I used his horses while he was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My horses? I have no further use for them. They can’t follow me through\\r\\nthe trenches and barbed wire—to the front; coming back ... they’ll bring\\r\\nme in a canvas. They’ll serve my successor.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have been perfectly useless to protest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a moment of silence when he seemed to be keenly interested in the\\r\\nripples of the water in the canal, he went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m going on leave to-morrow, to bid good-by to mine. That will be the\\r\\nlast. What are you doing this evening?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, Commander.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you want to make a tour of the sector with me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At your orders, Commander.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the last red rays of the sun setting on the heights to the north of\\r\\nthe Somme, we reached the lines through the open path which passed by\\r\\nthe camp kitchens and reached the hill of the Château de Cappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwilight passed, followed by the most varied colors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe red sun as it plunged behind the black poplars on the wide horizon\\r\\nflooded the sky with a great yellow light, fiery, burning yellow, like\\r\\nthe gold of flames which gradually grew thin and pale, and became light\\r\\nlike an immense head of hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little later mauve and violet precursors of approaching clouds passed\\r\\nslowly from pale to dark to end in night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clear moon came up above the plateau of the road from Amiens. We\\r\\nwalked on, one behind the other, in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped to look at the sky and I heard him murmur, “How beautiful it\\r\\nis.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis twilight must have recalled to him the skies of the Orient.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, the sunsets on the sea, in the Indies, in the Red Sea. I am\\r\\nhomesick for the light and the sea. The light, the sea, the woman; the\\r\\ngreatest joys, the greatest sorrows!!!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fell into his revery again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reached the orchard above the great quarry, and an outlying picket\\r\\nwarned us that the path was dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commander did not even hear him and continued to walk on the road\\r\\nfrom Herbècourt, bordered by apple trees in blossom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ta-co!”\\r\\n\\r\\nA German bullet tore through the night, and a broken branch with its\\r\\nwhite petals fell at our feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked it up and looked at it a long time; plucked a blossom and put\\r\\nit in his pocket,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Even the flowers!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said nothing more that evening. We went through the front lines of\\r\\nthe sector until late at night, stopping at the loopholes to observe the\\r\\nenemy’s position and questioning the sentries.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got back to Froissy at three o’clock in the morning, and at six he\\r\\nwent to the station at Guillaucourt and left on his leave.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he got back, the attack, they said, was near; they were preparing\\r\\nfor it seriously. He did not give up attending to the slightest details\\r\\nof the battalion. He showed a paternal interest in his men, knew the men\\r\\nof all ranks by their names, and stopped those he met and talked to them\\r\\nfamiliarly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battalion followed the deep path to the entrance of the “120 long” to\\r\\nget back to its positions. A wooden bridge had been constructed here by\\r\\nthe artillery to get their guns across. This was useless now and made the\\r\\nroad so narrow that the column had to dress back and form by twos. This\\r\\nlong manœuvre compelled the men to mark time in one spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing especially disagreeable about marking time for we have\\r\\nseen many other stops for less reasons, but this evening the Boche\\r\\nartillery had information of the arrival of the attacking regiment in the\\r\\nlines and was shelling heavily all possible ways of access.\\r\\n\\r\\nA single “77” falling into this crowd of men would make a hecatomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commander was marching at the head of the column followed by the\\r\\nintelligence officers of the companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped a moment in front of the bridge encircled by the explosions of\\r\\nthe shells.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If a shell would only destroy it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as if for spite, they fell all around and missed it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must be destroyed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing formal about this order, and the task wasn’t easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took off his belts, gave his jacket to a man, and with his chest bare\\r\\nthe commander stood up on the bridge, propped himself on the timbers of\\r\\nthe floor, and began to tear them up.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen men imitated him of their own accord. They finished tearing it down\\r\\namidst a storm of shells which raged about, and in the black smoke of the\\r\\nexplosions in which they disappeared for minutes at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a quarter of an hour the way was clear; all that was left was the two\\r\\nlaterals which were planted in the walls of the covered path.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battalion was engulfed in the whirlpool and passed without loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commander stood on the pile of materials and watched the men file\\r\\npast. He was the last one over.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we reached the line, he began to walk up and down incessantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire of our batteries had been uninterrupted for three days; and this\\r\\nwith the constant whizzing of shells as they passed over our heads put\\r\\nour nerves almost as much on edge as the strain of the approaching attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards eleven o’clock one night there was an intense calm all of a\\r\\nsudden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe firing ceased along the whole line—on both sides. All was silence,\\r\\nbut it was the silence which precedes the storm, the stupor of nature\\r\\nafter the flash and before the thunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men burrowed in the saps and fell asleep. The sentries who had not\\r\\nclosed an eye for forty-eight hours continued to fight against sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was almost impossible to recognize the commander in his bizarre garb,\\r\\nwrapped in a canvas instead of a waterproof, his steel helmet covered\\r\\nwith mud, as he wandered up and down the trenches, with a kind word of\\r\\nencouragement for each one.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the “Servian” trench there was an exposed passage to the German lines.\\r\\nThey had blocked this up by piles of sandbags, chevaux de frise, and\\r\\nrolls of barbed wire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a greater precaution, a sentry was stationed there night and day.\\r\\nHe was sleeping deeply when the commander came by. He had to shake him\\r\\nvigorously to wake him up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say, do you sleep like that when you’re sentry?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I ... it’s true ... I was asleep.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s not serious. Try hard, if an officer should come along, you’d not\\r\\nget off with advice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They won’t come along; they’re all snoozing in their dugouts.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you never know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’m going mad sooner or later. I haven’t slept a wink for three\\r\\nnights. If the Boches are as tired as I am they won’t come to wake us up.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he talked, his voice was drawn out more and more and his head nodded.\\r\\nHe was dead with sleep....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commander took his rifle from his hands and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not sleepy, and, besides, I shall sleep very well to-morrow. I’ll\\r\\nmount guard to-morrow. Sleep, little one, sleep. We, the old, have lost\\r\\nour habit of sleep.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sentry did not even acquiesce in this invitation. He had accepted it\\r\\nin advance, for he was asleep already.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt daybreak when the relief came, the sergeant who accompanied the new\\r\\nsentry was thunderstruck when he recognized the commander mounting guard\\r\\nat the loophole.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here’s his rifle. Wake him up when I have gone. Say nothing about it,\\r\\nfor he was very sleepy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the signal for the assault was given the next day, after our first\\r\\ntwo waves had gained the enemy trenches without firing a shot, the\\r\\ncommander, who was to go with the third, had scarcely advanced on the\\r\\nfield when the whistle of a single shell shattered the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nA “77” burst and a cloud of smoke went up. His thigh was torn off and we\\r\\nsaw him fall in a pool of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Delpos was getting ready to dash across with the second\\r\\nsection of the company and he jumped towards him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go on, my friend, the end has come. I am waiting for it. Tell Captain C\\r\\n... to take command of the battalion.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd during the slow agony which lasted a half hour he did not stop\\r\\nfollowing attentively the progress of his men on the conquered positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nStretcher-bearers carried his body to the church in Éclusier.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe buried him simply on the hill at the east of Cappy in a military\\r\\ncemetery near the canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the news of his death was known in the battalion, I know more than\\r\\na hundred who had seen their best comrades fall beside them, who wept as\\r\\nthough they had lost their fathers....\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was with us only a month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ATTACK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had been talking about it for months. The hour of the great attack has\\r\\nfinally come.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have been preparing for it ever since we were transformed into\\r\\ndiggers and sappers who dug trenches, parallels, communication trenches,\\r\\nand saps, day and night.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s going to succeed at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time the artillery preparation won’t be insufficient.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have guns, little and big, of every kind, of every caliber, from the\\r\\nlittle howitzers set low on their plates with their large muzzles like\\r\\nthose we used to see on the terrace of the Invalides up to the great\\r\\nnaval guns, long, lean and sharp, like a cigar, monumental guns of\\r\\nunheard-of size mounted on gigantic platforms, with covered turrets, new\\r\\nand odd foreign cannon, long as a train and mounted on rails.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there are projectiles such as the wildest imagination could not dream\\r\\nof. Whole fields of shells of every caliber from the small “75” which now\\r\\nseem like playthings to the enormous “400’s” which can be moved only by\\r\\ngigantic jacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd over this immense sea of shells they have stretched a green colored\\r\\ntarpaulin, dotted with great yellow spots, with great chalky streaks\\r\\nwhich in the distance give them the appearance of a field furrowed by\\r\\ntracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have been encamped in a wood for three days under tents beside\\r\\nbatteries of heavy artillery waiting for the order to take up our\\r\\npositions for the attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for these three days our constant occupation has been to strengthen\\r\\nand set up our huts again, for every shot from the great neighboring gun\\r\\ndrags them from the ground by the tremendous displacement of air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is all right in the daytime. This Penelope-like work relieves\\r\\nthe monotony and serves as a counter irritant to nervousness. But the\\r\\noccupation is less interesting at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, about nine o’clock one evening, a great uproar arose in the\\r\\ncompanies on the other side from us and by degrees, like a rising sea,\\r\\nreached us—we are in our usual place at the extreme wing of the battalion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adjutant had advanced to meet the news and he came back on the run.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s come this time. They are distributing the playthings to clear the\\r\\ntrenches and they’re going to give out an additional cup of brandy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you believe it will be before to-morrow morning?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do I believe it. It’s sure, by God! Perhaps you want them to wait until\\r\\nnext winter!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, but you know. There have been so many orders and counter-orders that\\r\\none can never be sure. It ought to rain.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you think it will rain?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good God! I wish it would. The sooner we finish the performance, the\\r\\nsooner we’ll get to bed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonel’s orderly arrives with the orders:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Casanova company of machine guns will support the second battalion\\r\\nand will take the designated objective (Hill 707) directly after the\\r\\nthird wave.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The third wave! Hum! That’s not good. The first wave is a promenade,\\r\\nnothing in front. The second goes over then, but the third has all the\\r\\nshells, for it’s right in the barrage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And after?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“After?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say, you must think you’re in a café at La Cannebière. Perhaps you’d\\r\\nlike to order an ice. This is war, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see it now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe distributions are finished at ten o’clock and we move towards our\\r\\npositions behind the second battalion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men have taken off their belts and all their useless equipment and\\r\\nare in jackets with their tent canvas crosswise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diluvial rain which has been falling for some days has stopped this\\r\\nevening. The sky is as black as ink and we can’t see a yard in front of\\r\\nus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paths were already muddy, but now they have disappeared after whole\\r\\nregiments have gone towards the lines without interruption for some\\r\\nhours. When we reach the communication trench it is no longer a trench at\\r\\nall, but a stream of fluid mud, where we sink over our leggings. We have\\r\\nto use our hands to pull out our legs when they get stuck.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, _mon vieux_, if we have to go clear to Berlin at this pace, we\\r\\nwon’t get there before to-morrow morning!...”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is so dark that we can scarcely see the back of the comrade in front\\r\\nof us. We march in silence, with our hands on the sheaths of the bayonet\\r\\nand our mask case to prevent the metal striking against the sides of the\\r\\ntrench.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is after two o’clock when we reach the lines. We take our places as\\r\\nbest we can, where we can, and with what we can find.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saps are filled with companies in reserve who will guard the trench\\r\\nwhile we fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe find places against the sides of the trench, in chance dugouts gashed\\r\\nin the parapet. We have to be careful to keep our feet underneath us to\\r\\navoid having our toes crushed in the incessant coming and going to and\\r\\nfro.\\r\\n\\r\\nRifts in the clouds show us that the sky is clearing. It will be fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe talk. We weigh optimistically our chances of success. But we have to\\r\\nshout into each other’s ears or we couldn’t hear anything. Above us is\\r\\nthe infernal roar of an incessant bombardment.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur guns have fired some days without interruption. And the men never\\r\\ncease praising the heavy artillery. We have never been supported in this\\r\\nway. How far we are from the days in Champagne! We have confidence,\\r\\nabsolute confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay comes. The sun rises, the bright clear sun, which will be warm soon,\\r\\nrises over the ridge behind us. On the broad, many-colored screen of\\r\\nthe sky with its rays of dawning day, the chimney of the distillery at\\r\\nFrameville, still intact and standing as though hurling defiance at the\\r\\nGermans, stands out monumental and black like a gigantic obelisk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe countryside never stood out so clearly. I note the slightest\\r\\ndetails with a feeling which can never be effaced. I continue to look\\r\\npersistently to overcome my nervousness and to have something else to\\r\\nthink about.\\r\\n\\r\\nI look....\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow, in advance, are light lines of freshly turned earth. They are\\r\\nthe German trenches, and I think I can see among the apparent ruins the\\r\\ninvisible loopholes ready to belch forth death. A little further to the\\r\\nleft, a few yards from the sides of the cliff is a small clump of woods\\r\\nwhich seems quiet and deserted. Our shells have started fires, but the\\r\\nfortified positions which conceal the machine guns are still there.\\r\\n\\r\\nI look....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ground and slope in front of me, close to the parapet, is empty,\\r\\nbare, torn full of shell holes. Young trees have been cut down, and\\r\\nthe fallen trees are rotting in the earth under the growing moss. But\\r\\ndaisies, buttercups, wild poppies, and cornflowers have sprung up and\\r\\nblossomed, opening out to nature, the sun, and life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the fires will shortly rage on these flowers. The blood of men will\\r\\nflow on them, and to-morrow their sweetness will be mingled with the\\r\\ncharnel-house of corpses ... our corpses.\\r\\n\\r\\nNature has never seemed to me so moving. Tears come to my eyes. It is\\r\\nnot fear. No, it is not that. There are times when one may be afraid.\\r\\nHere we realize that fear is a reflex impression, ridiculous, and above\\r\\nall useless; that the minutes which are left are perhaps too numbered to\\r\\nwaste in vain sentiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while I look through the mirage of nature, I have seen a small\\r\\nshriveled figure with trembling lips, and eyes hollowed with pain and\\r\\nfright; I have seen small hands—long, pale, emaciated hands—clasped\\r\\nbefore a photograph; I have heard the expression so many times, read it\\r\\nso many times in the letters on my breast, on my heart: “Tell me that you\\r\\nwill come back. You are my all, father, mother, brother, child, husband;\\r\\ntell me that you will be careful, that you will come back to me,” and a\\r\\nslight uncontrollable, nervous trembling takes hold of me; but no one can\\r\\nsee it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blast of the whistle—the final order—rings out. I find myself on\\r\\nthe slope without knowing how I came there, in the midst of the others,\\r\\nbeside the lieutenant, at my post.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder a protecting storm of our “75’s” we advance towards our objective.\\r\\nThe battalion has already crossed the first line of the Boche trenches\\r\\nwithout resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll nervousness is gone now. I am very cool. The third wave advances in\\r\\nfront of us in good order, in step, without heavy losses. We march in\\r\\ntheir wake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, thirty yards away, on the right is a knoll. That is our objective\\r\\nwhich we must occupy to prevent the enemy’s reserves coming up.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe draw nearer; my heart begins to beat violently. It is nervousness. It\\r\\nis the beginning of the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly a sharp noise stops me; then another beside my ear.\\r\\nInstinctively I throw myself on the hill. A sergeant falls near me\\r\\nwithout a word. He is dead, a bullet in the middle of his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are under the fire of a machine gun which defends the approach to our\\r\\nobjective.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bullets whistle in a continuous buzz around us. A sharp burning pain,\\r\\nlike a sting; a cry stops in my throat, on my very lips. I fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fusillade rages. To the right, to the left, around me everywhere,\\r\\nbullets bury themselves in the ground. I am wounded, but where? All my\\r\\nlimbs are numb.\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel a hand take mine and grasp it. It is the lieutenant, who has\\r\\nalready come running to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-by for the present.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“For the present.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is nothing. A stone hurled violently by the bursting of a shell has\\r\\nhit me in the back. It has just missed killing me. I remain there a\\r\\nmoment without being able to get my breath back or to get up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll around there is an incessant rain of bullets and shrapnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I can’t remain there right in the barrage. I make an effort to\\r\\ncatch up with the company. My fall which took only a few seconds has put\\r\\nconsiderable distance between the wave and me. More than three hundred\\r\\nyards separate us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to run after it, but I can’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nA greenish cloud rolls like a flood over the plain. The enemy is\\r\\nlaunching gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome one out of breath joins me. It is Morin who took a message to the\\r\\nmajor. He is now carrying an order to the lieutenant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is dangerous.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One might think so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Commandant Courier was just killed getting out of the parallel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A ‘155’ square in the chest. It killed two officers and five men. I’ve a\\r\\nsplinter in my thigh and one in my shoulder.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: THE ATTACK _See page 225_]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe walk along side by side as fast as we can, but slowly nevertheless.\\r\\nWe can’t do anything else. We get tangled in the barbed wire; we stumble\\r\\nover corpses; we fall headlong into shell holes. The mud covers the mica\\r\\nin my mask.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hundred yards in front of us the company reaches its objective, the\\r\\nhill and the Boche blockhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo sections have rushed in and are already in action.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo more sections throw themselves into a crater more to the left\\r\\nopposite a clump of trees which is still held by the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly there is a terrific explosion, and the most violent clap of\\r\\nthunder that can be imagined sends us head over heels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ground trembles, the earth cracks, and through the crevices oozes a\\r\\nblack smoke which envelops us. Everything is black. Are we entombed?\\r\\n\\r\\nA mine has been exploded near us in the entrance. They shout; they cry.\\r\\nBelts of cartridges burst in the furnace. A swarm of bees seems to fly\\r\\nover our heads. The blockhouse has just blown up with our two sections.\\r\\nIt was mined.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the smoke lifts from the overturned ground, all we can see are\\r\\ncorpses scattered about. Our comrades ... our dead!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy wanted to prevent our companies capturing and organizing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe try to see something from the shell hole where we remain. It is\\r\\ncertain death even to try to raise the head. The bullets glance off the\\r\\nground.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorin wants to join the lieutenant and finish his errand in spite of\\r\\neverything, but where is he? Was he in the blockhouse? We can’t see\\r\\nanyone in front of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur waves of infantry have turned to the right, invested Herbècourt, and\\r\\ntaken it. They are now fighting in the village. We judge from the columns\\r\\nof smoke that there are fires. The noise of the explosion of grenades\\r\\nreaches us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in front of us there is no one. It is a breach. The breach our\\r\\ncompany ought to have held firmly closed with its machine guns during the\\r\\nattack on the village.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy knows this without a doubt. He has calculated his blow well. He\\r\\nhas succeeded. He is going to launch out from the clump of trees and take\\r\\nour companies in the rear.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed that is the case. Groups of gray worms crawl out of the thicket.\\r\\nThey reach the ridge. They are a hundred yards from us. There is no one\\r\\nto stop them. But where are our two sections? Are they wiped out too?\\r\\n\\r\\n“My old Morin, we’re done for.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur hands clasp in a fraternal farewell. In three minutes the Boches will\\r\\nbe on us. They will kill us pitilessly. We hold our revolvers ready,\\r\\nfingers on the trigger. At least we won’t go alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stand up now and shout. They are going to make a dash.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Vorwaerts! Gottfordam isch!_”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe harsh sound of the command and the oath comes to us clearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey dash forward to take the crater.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut almost at the end, at scarcely fifty yards, the four guns of our two\\r\\nsections, hidden in the shell holes, receive them with a withering fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boche line cracks, breaks; groups of men fall in heaps, like puppets.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur guns fire constantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boche line wavers, hesitates, the ranks thin out. We can hear the\\r\\ndead sound of the falling bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe laugh and laugh; we applaud, crying like fools:\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are our two sections. Bravo!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut behind the files that fall are others in greater numbers which\\r\\nadvance in close ranks, one after another.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur fire is slower. Our munitions are exhausted—the gun crew is firing\\r\\nall the cartridges of their carbines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assailants realize this. Some of the groups have already reached our\\r\\nemplacements. An incredibly tall and strong officer hurls himself on a\\r\\ngun. It is Marseille’s gun. It has been silent just a moment, but it\\r\\nhasn’t finished its task for all that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarseille tears the barrel from the tripod, and using it as a gigantic\\r\\nmace beats the officer to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nA terrible hand to hand fight follows. The lieutenant, wounded, dripping\\r\\nwith blood, on his knees on the parapet, stops the demoralized enemy with\\r\\nshots from his revolver.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this heroic defense of the breach can’t last long. Most of our\\r\\nmen have fallen and most of the rest are wounded. The enemy is still\\r\\nadvancing, in close ranks now. He is going to get by....\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, from the support trench, which the ... first Territorials hold, a\\r\\ncompany dashes out like a whirlwind, with an irresistible dash. It throws\\r\\nthe mass of the enemy into disorder, and it is soon just a mob, which\\r\\nturns its back and flees frantically, as fast as it can go, falling under\\r\\nour rifle fire, and strewing the ground with corpses and innumerable\\r\\nwounded who drag themselves along on the ground begging for mercy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nWITH ORDERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“There he is, Captain,” shouted a non-commissioned intelligence officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is necessary,” said the captain, “to take this order to the\\r\\nlieutenant commanding your company at once. You’ll find that it’s only a\\r\\npromenade. Go ahead.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA promenade!\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the Château de Cappy where the headquarters of our brigade were all\\r\\none could see that morning on the horizon was smoke and flame.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earth trembles as though there were some sort of a fanciful,\\r\\ncontinuous earthquake.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the attack began and our waves crossed the first Boche lines, the\\r\\nenemy’s artillery planted on the heights of Cléry, Mont St. Quentin,\\r\\nBarleux has sent over a formidable barrage to prevent all possibility of\\r\\nthe arrival of reinforcements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt hopes to cut off in the rear the forces engaged in the attack,\\r\\nto encircle them, to exterminate or capture them. A wall of shell\\r\\nand fire separates them from us. Three hundred yards in front of the\\r\\nheights of the La Vache woods from La Vierge clear to Dompierre and\\r\\nFontaine-les-Cappy, it is one uninterrupted explosion of great shells\\r\\nwhich throw to great heights enormous masses of earth and stones almost\\r\\nas though they were gushing from the bowels of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis waste of shells is further beautified with “tear” shells and\\r\\nasphyxiating shells and is designed to stop all attempts at passing the\\r\\nbarrage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the delightful place in which I have to take a “promenade.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI adjust my mask, make sure that the straps are on, and secure my steel\\r\\nhelmet by the chin strap.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the order in the pocket of my revolver case, a solid boxwood baton\\r\\nin my hand, I start towards the fiery furnace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe communication trench which I try to follow is impracticable. It\\r\\nis partly blown in and such dugouts as are still tenable are full of\\r\\nwounded fleeing from the zone of combat. They crowd in pell-mell in their\\r\\nefforts to find a breathing place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, sooner or later, after the La Vache woods are passed, one has to\\r\\nwalk absolutely unprotected so one might as well go at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew projectiles are falling here on the great quarry as yet, but only\\r\\na few shots too long or too short from the great guns aimed at the\\r\\nammunition depot at Froissy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe barrage is further on....\\r\\n\\r\\nAs one approaches it, the earth and air seem to tremble even more....\\r\\n\\r\\nOne walks on a moving wave, as if tossed about on the bridge of a ship.\\r\\nA displacement of air throws one to the right, the next one to the left.\\r\\nThey march swaying like drunken men.\\r\\n\\r\\nI approach....\\r\\n\\r\\nSome steps in front of what was the “Servian” trench is the beginning of\\r\\nHell.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen, officers, and stretcher-bearers are crouching in holes in\\r\\nhalf-blown-in saps, waiting for a lull which for several hours has not\\r\\ncome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sick and wounded, haggard and frightened, do not dare to make a move\\r\\noutside the precarious shelters which even the smallest shell would\\r\\ndestroy and bury them alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Zouave, with a swarthy face and a profile like a medallion,\\r\\ngesticulates and shouts. A long gash cuts his forehead from the arch of\\r\\nhis eyebrows to the ear; the blood flows thick and black on his cheek and\\r\\nruns into his beard. He waves a rag on the end of a stick.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The noubah! the noubah! It is the noubah! They are going to dance.\\r\\nYou’ll dance with me, won’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he runs towards the bombs, laughing a frightful laugh which makes me\\r\\nshudder. Poor fool! A hole opens under his feet. He falls. Perhaps the\\r\\nfall will save him from a mortal wound.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Colonials, fatalists, accustomed to so many other storms—for two\\r\\nyears they have been in the hottest part of all the engagements—talk\\r\\ncoolly under a dugout which is still intact. They squat on their crossed\\r\\nlegs and smoke peacefully. The smoke from their pipes, rising in slow\\r\\neasy curves, seems to set at defiance the frightful cataclysm which rages\\r\\naround us.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stretcher-bearer, a priest, whom I think I recognize, is dressing a\\r\\nwounded man who has escaped in some way from the furnace and who faints\\r\\nin his arms. Intent on his bandaging he seems to have no idea of the Hell\\r\\ntwo steps away. He gives him the same care with the same imperturbable\\r\\ncalm that he would in the absolute security of some faraway ambulance.\\r\\n\\r\\nA staff-officer, a captain, is observing the ground through a glass. As\\r\\nis my case, he is carrying an urgent order which cannot wait.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looks at me and understands from my attitude that I, too, must go on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall we try it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you wish, Captain.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In case of accident, my pocketbook is in the pocket of my jacket, here\\r\\n... you will take it to the officer of details of the ... first Zouaves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mine is here, Captain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI indicate the left pocket of my tunic.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let’s go.”\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nHe grasps my hand and we advance flat on the ground, bounding from one\\r\\nshell hole to another farther ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe compel our bodies to take the shape of the excavation in which we\\r\\nburrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove our heads is a continuous whistling of shells, cutting like a\\r\\nsword, and the constant djji-djji of the projectiles which tear up the\\r\\nground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe explosions are so frequent that we perceive only one infernal noise\\r\\nunder a rain of fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe crawl through an indescribable chaos, in a field of terror, in the\\r\\nmidst of a pungent, fetid smoke. We reach the first German trench which\\r\\nwe conquered yesterday morning. We jump into it; we are dripping with\\r\\nperspiration; our clothes are in rags. Our first act is to raise our\\r\\nmasks for we are stifling under them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe asphyxiating shells now fall behind us, and their noxious gas blows\\r\\nin another direction away from us. We stop for some seconds to regain our\\r\\nbreaths. We must go on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we are about to climb out on the field again, I see one of our\\r\\ncouriers coming at full speed. I must wait for him and learn where my\\r\\ncompany is.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he stops, leans backwards, and his hands contract and seem to try to\\r\\npull something from his breast. He falls inert.\\r\\n\\r\\nI crawl towards him. A spasm still shakes him. He looks at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The company! Where is the company?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“——Maisonnette——” he murmurs in a faraway breath, then, with an effort,\\r\\nhis shaking hand reaches towards his jacket, but without success.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sergeant-Major ... there ... there ... to my mother ... in La Ciotat....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, _mon vieux_, yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is dead. I am trembling but I search for his pocketbook. It is sewed\\r\\nin a handkerchief and in drawing it out it is spotted with blood—his\\r\\nblood. I shall send it to his mother just that way. It is forbidden, but\\r\\nwhat difference does that make? I have promised.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Maisonnette! It is still three miles, perhaps more. I’ll never get\\r\\nthere! The staff-officer leaves me; he is going to the La Chapitre woods\\r\\nto the left.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe grasp hands once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thanks.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, thanks! Together we have done a most difficult thing—we have passed\\r\\nthrough a barrage.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I go on across that terrible plateau, alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlone!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a splinter of a shell hits me, no one will be with me during my last\\r\\nmoments to listen to my final wishes. I continue my way under the rain of\\r\\nshells.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy I have not already been blown to pieces or buried I do not know. How\\r\\nlittle one feels in the face of this formidable power!\\r\\n\\r\\nI turn around. On both sides and behind me there is no one! I am in a\\r\\ndesert in which a hail of fire falls. Will I get there?\\r\\n\\r\\nAt every step I cross, touch, jump over, as I run against them, formless\\r\\ncorpses, cut to pieces, or doubled into knots.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps in a moment I shall be like them, disemboweled and my brains\\r\\nrunning out, or like those over there buried under rubbish and dirt. I\\r\\ncan see a foot here, an arm there; they are entombed forever. I shall be\\r\\nlisted among the missing, and my family and those who love me will cling\\r\\nto this shred of hope—that the missing is perhaps not dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nI go on steadily.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbruptly, I experience a nervous reaction. I laugh.... I become a\\r\\nfatalist! And after?... I shall not be alone. That’s the common lot of\\r\\nmillions of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is going to happen will happen. Forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I crawl on anew, thinking of everything else—a mass of things a\\r\\nhundred leagues away; trifles; paltry trifles. I surprise myself by\\r\\nmaking plans which I shall realize after the war—when that is over! And,\\r\\nnevertheless, death hovers over me constantly, threatening, and I am much\\r\\nnearer to it than life.\\r\\n\\r\\nA trench opens before me; it is not badly demolished. I enter it and find\\r\\nthat it is an old one taken from the enemy this morning. German words\\r\\nindicate directions. They abandoned all their belongings. On a plank in\\r\\na sentry post is a superb pair of prismatic field glasses. I pick them\\r\\nup—what use are they to me? I throw them down at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have enough to look out for close by without trying to see what’s\\r\\nhappening farther away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Nach Maisonnette._”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis direction before my eyes fascinates me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To Maisonnette.” Well, I’m on the right track. If the trench continues\\r\\nlike this I have some chance of arriving there: _nach Maisonnette_.\\r\\n\\r\\nI mark the directions at each turn of the trench, at each branch.\\r\\n\\r\\nA big shell bursts on my left and utterly destroys the whole of the wall\\r\\nbehind me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI take another course. The devil! Suppose that should be wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nI reach a sort of crater made up of stones and trunks of trees blown\\r\\napart and broken, in one complete tangle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would hardly be wise to stay here, for the crater is hammered full of\\r\\nshell holes.\\r\\n\\r\\nA voice comes out of the ground between the stones, at my feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, good morning, Margis. Keep to the right; the first street to the\\r\\nleft is Peronne.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognize the joking voice and constant laugh of Sub-Lieutenant Delpos.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have arrived; the company is here!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis hole is Maisonnette!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll right!...\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I jump into the protection of the bottom of the sap.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite wine, brandy, fine preserves. Sub-Lieutenant Delpos never lacks for\\r\\nanything even in the most tragic hours of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe makes an elegant and comfortable dugout out of the most filthy hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen miles from the living world, six feet under ground, in the midst of\\r\\nthe shell fire, ten feet from the enemy, he offers me, with a laugh, a\\r\\nmeal which is prodigious under the circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoharé makes coffee on a burner and he flavors it with brandy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe talk of many things, of a thousand things, all a hundred leagues\\r\\nremoved from the war. We talk about Marseilles.\\r\\n\\r\\nSub-Lieutenant Delpos is a lover of its picturesqueness, of its color,\\r\\nits sun—we are in a deep sap lighted by a smoky candle—the sun means\\r\\nsomething to us, something fairylike and superhuman. To think that at\\r\\nthat hour there are people living under clear skies, coming and going and\\r\\nbreathing the strong sea breeze, and drinking in with their eyes that\\r\\nperpetual delight—a sunset on the rocks of Frioul!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the women of Marseilles! They are the quintessence of France,\\r\\nrevivified by the air of the Mediterranean. Just think, _mon cher_, of\\r\\na villa perched in the pines, facing the sea, in the valley of L’Oriol,\\r\\nwith a brunette that I know,\\r\\n\\r\\n...! ...!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I forget, I must present you to the other gentlemen. Come.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe emerge from the sap and come out in broad daylight. In a crater\\r\\norganized in the expectation of a probable counter attack, guarded by the\\r\\nstrongest men of the section, twelve German prisoners are stretched out\\r\\nin the mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of them stand up automatically at the appearance of an officer and\\r\\nassume a rigid military attitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look at that rabble with their blessed faces like professors of natural\\r\\nhistory or like sacristans mumbling their prayers. Who would think to\\r\\nlook at them that they are such cynical brutes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I forgot. You speak German!... Try and get something out of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I ask them where they come from.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one replies. Their eyes remain hostile and timid and full of fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey distrust one another; informing is the common practice in their\\r\\nranks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI look at one in particular, and, taking him by the arm,\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Dü! wohen bist dü dann?_”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Aus München...._”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Munich. Munich! I passed the best days of my youth there. Its\\r\\nsplendid life, the magic of its lakes, the first iridescent snows of the\\r\\nTyrol reflecting in their dark waters, the intoxication of its music,\\r\\nMunich! the city of my dreams! The mystic grayish tints of the inns more\\r\\nsmoky even than those of Auerbach but lighter, the impressive harmony of\\r\\nthe statues, its incomparable museums, the June evenings on the Isar and\\r\\nthe blue sunsets of the Propylées. Munich! And this man in rags, this\\r\\ntatterdemalion speaks to me of Munich.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Margis, are you wandering?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Lieutenant. As a matter of fact I was woolgathering.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I come back to cruel reality.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Since you must return to the brigade at once, you can take this crowd\\r\\nto the provost. I’ll give you four men. That will be enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, Lieutenant, but I’ll not guarantee to deliver them whole.\\r\\nIt’s a bad neighborhood. It rains shells.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looks at them and they are ready. All they have to do is to group\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go ahead, au revoir,—and a safe return.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Nun jetz Vorwaerts!_”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe go back along the road I came by this morning. The artillery fire has\\r\\nlet up a little. As far as the crossing of the roads from Biaches to\\r\\nHerbècourt, we march along without much risk, but beyond there we are\\r\\ntaken anew by a crossfire from the batteries of Barleux and Hem, and by\\r\\nthe fire of a cursed machine gun. It seems to be hidden in the ruins of\\r\\nFlaucourt, but our artillery has not been able to spot it yet and silence\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy twelve prisoners march along ahead silently with bowed shoulders. They\\r\\nunderstand that they must march along peacefully at the same pace as the\\r\\nfour big fellows who form the escort, and that once out of this zone\\r\\ntheir lives are saved.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reach without incident the old road which cuts the Le Signal woods,\\r\\nand get back on the road from Herbècourt to Éclusier. An orchard here\\r\\nwhich before the attack was a signal station has not suffered much. The\\r\\ndugouts are whole and I stop my troop to look after my leg which has\\r\\nbegun to bleed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little while ago, as I was crossing some barbed wire entanglements, I\\r\\nfelt a tear but I thought it was of no consequence. But now the blood\\r\\nhas soaked through the drawers and trousers. I tear off a strip from my\\r\\npackage of dressings and put on a bandage which stops the bleeding until\\r\\nwe reach the next dressing station.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have hardly put my equipment on again than I hear beyond me in the road\\r\\nan infernal noise of scrap iron, oaths and cries.\\r\\n\\r\\nI jump up.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is our movable kitchen driven by Gondran. Yesterday, it went ahead to\\r\\nHerbècourt on premature orders. To-day, it was right in the barrage. Now\\r\\nthat the long expected lull has come, the lieutenant is sending it back\\r\\nto Froissy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way back Gondran met four wounded men who were getting to the\\r\\nrear only with the greatest difficulty, and he took them on his rickety\\r\\nwagon. This torpedo, with its big sheet-iron smokestack which is full\\r\\nof holes and twisted, doesn’t look much like an ambulance. Instead, one\\r\\nmight think it was some archaic engine of war of the Gauls.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhoebe and Lidoire, the two lean hacks which drag it, are marked and cut\\r\\nby the harness and their legs are bent from pulling this badly balanced\\r\\nweight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, the bombardment, which seemed to have ceased, begins again.\\r\\nFirst two shots, then repeated more and more rapidly, and only in our\\r\\ndirection. A shower of splinters beats around us, wounds the two horses\\r\\nand cuts the reins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey run away at a mad pace with wild plunges through the fields. Gondran\\r\\nis wounded in the hands and is helpless; he clings to the smokestack; the\\r\\nwounded are tossed about. They shout from the pain of their re-opened\\r\\nwounds and hang on as best they can to the handle of the kettle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speed of the two horses becomes giddy. They head for the quarry at\\r\\na gallop. A hundred yards more and they will inevitably fall into the\\r\\ncanal, a fall of more than fifty yards. That would mean their utter\\r\\ndestruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have no choice of ways in which to save the five men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith six shots from my revolver I kill one horse and throw the other to\\r\\nthe ground. The kitchen comes to a stop twenty yards from the cliff.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut danger is not averted by any manner of means. Shells follow us. From\\r\\nsome faraway place an observer must have taken us for a “75” getting into\\r\\nposition and he tries to destroy us. We abandon the kitchen which is now\\r\\nalmost completely done for, and as fast as we can, saved by some miracle\\r\\nfrom the shells, which double in intensity, we throw ourselves into the\\r\\nfirst trench we find.\\r\\n\\r\\nI find the Territorials and the provost at the great quarry and I hand my\\r\\nprisoners over to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is only a step from there to headquarters. I arrive at six o’clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Chatain is outside the door, and I give him the reply he is\\r\\nwaiting for.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe runs it over with a smile of satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everything went all right, Sergeant-Major?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Captain.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good. Didn’t I tell you that it would simply be a promenade ... but I’ll\\r\\nrecommend you for a citation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour later I was snoring soundly in a dugout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\nA WREATH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe fell back in good order—in as good order as our wounds and the enemy’s\\r\\nartillery fire permitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a roll call of the company, now reduced in numbers by half, in\\r\\nthe ruins of Dompierre, now cleared out, conquered and organized.\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of the two sections surprised in the explosion of the mine came back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are great gaps in the ranks of the other two, especially among the\\r\\nnon-commissioned officers. One sergeant out of four and two or three\\r\\ncorporals are seriously wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs names are called and there is no response, we look around as though\\r\\nto search better. Lips seem to murmur, “What, he too?” Eyes search the\\r\\ndistance, the turn of the road at the entrance of the village, as if they\\r\\nstill expect to see him come. But no one comes. They will never come\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lieutenant has to furnish all possible information about each one\\r\\nmissing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you see him fall? Who was near him? Was he wounded? Do you think he\\r\\nwas killed? Did he stay there motionless?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were as many inexact replies as there were questions. No one knew\\r\\nexactly or could know exactly whether the fallen was killed or wounded;\\r\\nappearances are deceitful. In the uproar of battle, he who seems dead\\r\\nis not even touched. Another may have had to stay hidden a long time to\\r\\navoid being killed or made a prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpposite the name of each absent one the quartermaster writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Missing the ... presumably killed at....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the roll call we separate silently. The most severely wounded are\\r\\nat the dressing stations, and several are discharged by the ambulances\\r\\nfrom the rear: Sergeant Pierron had four fingers of his right hand\\r\\nblown off; Sergeant Durosiers with a shoulder broken by a bit of shell;\\r\\nCorporal Goutelle shot through the thigh, and has lost a lot of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe accompany them as far as the ambulances which take them to the\\r\\ncasualty clearing stations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdjutant Dotant and Sergeant Lace take the initiative in buying a wreath\\r\\nand take up a collection among the men of their sections.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lieutenant, if you will allow us, we are going to buy a wreath at\\r\\nHarbonnières and this evening two of us will go and place it on our\\r\\ncomrades.”\\r\\n\\r\\nToo moved to answer, the lieutenant acquiesces with a nod.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorin and I, the only two who are not wounded, offer to carry it. Our\\r\\nerrand is not without danger; but we start off at nightfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wreath is light but large, and its width makes it difficult to get\\r\\nthrough the narrow trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to hold it at arms’ length in certain places above our heads on\\r\\nthe parapet and slide it along.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts ornaments catch in the stones and the twigs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt runs serious dangers before it reaches its destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Herbècourt the trench stops some yards in front of the entrance to the\\r\\nvillage. It is raining shells.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shells rage particularly on the road which runs through the\\r\\nvillage, the only one along which supplies can go. There is no longer\\r\\na well-marked road. The well taken care of highway no longer exists;\\r\\nit is full of holes and is but one yawning crevasse more than three\\r\\nhundred yards long. The wagons and trucks have made a chance path in the\\r\\nneighboring fields. They wait at the entrance of the village, some yards\\r\\nfrom the point where the barrage persists, for a lull. When it comes,\\r\\nthey rush like a whirlwind with a mad burst of speed, and it is a miracle\\r\\nthat they are not crushed. All one hears are oaths, cries, blows; wagons\\r\\nlock together, horses fall and get up at once; all this in the twinkling\\r\\nof an eye. Thirty wagons pass between two shells.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe, too, make a dash and reach the other end without much risk. The\\r\\ndanger is greater from the autos which rush by us like meteors, graze\\r\\nus, and threaten a hundred times to cut us to pieces or to catch our\\r\\nclothes and drag us under the wheels. But the greatest danger is from the\\r\\ntottering walls, and the waving roofs which the rolling of the wagons\\r\\nbrings falling down.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reach the cemetery at the beginning of the country. It is still nearly\\r\\nintact. Graves are turned up; tombstones are thrown down on their sides.\\r\\nIts walls are holed with loopholes, which served the last defenders of\\r\\nthe village. But the grass is not even tramped down in the corners.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t we stay here five minutes to get our breath?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you want to.... We deserve it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA battery of “75’s” held the position a few minutes ago. It has just\\r\\nabandoned it to get nearer the lines. The place is deserted; it is like a\\r\\nvisit in the country at two steps from the fiery furnace. We stretch out\\r\\non a mound of turf between two tombs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the hour of twilight; the sky is golden; the sun on the horizon\\r\\nplunges into the marshes of the Somme. A fresh breeze blows through the\\r\\nprivet hedge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A summer evening in the country!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Within the country would be more in accord with the circumstances, I\\r\\nthink.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if to make my punning more emphatic, four “77’s” burst at the same\\r\\ntime and smash the cemetery walls to bits.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Foutre!_” This expression, peculiar to Marseilles, has a significant\\r\\nmeaning on Morin’s lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have said it; the place is no longer safe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The battery changed its position because it had just been spotted. We\\r\\nare taking its place and are a target for the Boche artillery.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe make our way forward as fast as we can.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bombardment of the abandoned position behind us continues in volleys\\r\\nof four shells at a time. The cemetery we just left is nothing but a\\r\\nruin, a chaos from which black smoke rises.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe keep on running, each holding an end of the wreath which impedes us\\r\\nterribly. Although it is light, it seems heavy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight falls and it is very dark. We are able to advance with more\\r\\nsecurity now. Yawning craters open at our feet; we risk falls and sprains\\r\\nat every step.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the dead of night when we reach the place where our company was\\r\\ndecimated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn immense mass of humanity fills the place with a tragic tangle of\\r\\nintertwined corpses. Burned with powder, licked by the flames, torn and\\r\\nblown to pieces, the bodies cling to the wall as if they wanted to fly\\r\\nfrom the deadly fire coming from the depths of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, planted on this host of bodies, his legs sinking in up to\\r\\nhis knees, the body of Sergeant Bacque seems to point out the road to\\r\\ndeliverance with a gesture. His hands hold the pickets of a cheval de\\r\\nfrise. A shell decapitated him at the very moment when he jumped and\\r\\ndeath fixed him in this attitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nThin smoke still comes from the bottom of this sinister vat! It is Hell\\r\\nin all its horror. The men saw death coming and tried to flee, but death\\r\\nwas victor and fixed them to the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe burial of our friends would be a titanic task for our exhausted\\r\\nstrength. We gather into a single pile the scattered bodies which the\\r\\nexplosion hurled to a distance. With some barbed wire we hang the\\r\\ncompany’s wreath on the cheval de frise which commands the great grave.\\r\\nIt faces the Boches.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-morrow at sunrise they can see it from their nearest trench and read\\r\\non its tricolored ribbon the inscription, “To our comrades, to our\\r\\nbrothers, from the survivors of the second company of machine guns.” They\\r\\nwill see how we pay homage to our heroes even under the threat of their\\r\\nshells.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drone of a cannon sounds in the English sector in the distance. One\\r\\nmight think that there was a tacit truce on our side to let the dead\\r\\nsleep more peacefully in their last sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe remain there kneeling before the hecatomb. Our lips search for the\\r\\nprayers of our childhood to lay our dead at rest, but they have lost\\r\\nthe habit of prayer and our memories fail at the first words. We wish\\r\\na prayer which shall give their final blessing to the bodies stretched\\r\\nout there, but above all we want a prayer which shall give a kindly\\r\\nconsolation in the approaching hour of anguish to those who wait—to the\\r\\nmothers, wives, sweethearts, who do not know, who hope and live in the\\r\\ndream of their joyous return. And our scepticism makes us unable to pray.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe darkness of the night is absolute.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe charnel-house of our comrades is only a dark mass in the shadows. A\\r\\npungent, pestilential odor already rises; we sense the sinister rustling\\r\\nof the rats which slip between the bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nGroans rise on all sides in the darkness. Some shriek horribly in their\\r\\nagony; there are long wails; plaintive sing-songs call beloved names,\\r\\nchildish words.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath, with its accomplice, Darkness, gleans the last rebellious one who\\r\\nclings desperately to life.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind us mounts the heavy rolling of the convoys. It is the hour for\\r\\nthe nightly supplies. The autos dash along on the torn up roads in the\\r\\nendeavor to accomplish their difficult mission before the probable\\r\\nbarrage fire begins again.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the top of the ridge where the enemy maintains his lines for the\\r\\nmoment, a searchlight throws its light on the ground and in the sky, in\\r\\nall directions, watching for aeroplanes and searching for the passing\\r\\nof convoys on the road. Its light passes back and forth over us several\\r\\ntimes, hitting us in the face and dazzling us. It passes back and forth,\\r\\nflooding the plain with its moving brilliant light. In its light we see\\r\\nmoving forms: stretcher-bearers saving the wounded and plunderers of the\\r\\ndead.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, the whizz of a shell comes our way, and a light bursts high in\\r\\nthe air. Shrapnel launch their rain of fire and shell on the plain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let’s go....”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had scarcely time to throw ourselves flat on the ground when there\\r\\nwas a tremendous explosion. A “380” perhaps bursts on the middle of the\\r\\nmound of corpses and scatters it. One would think that maddened by its\\r\\norgy of murder, the enemy horde wants to kill our dead anew. A geyser of\\r\\nblood spouts up and boils from the mound.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe try to flee but our limbs fail us. An invincible force rivets us to\\r\\nthe spot, as we try to jump ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorin utters a hoarse cry, a cry like an animal that is being\\r\\nslaughtered. A corpse was thrown up in the air and falls squarely on\\r\\nhim and throws him to the ground. He is underneath, hemmed in by its\\r\\nshrivelled arms; streams of blood deluge him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI try to get him out, but I can’t. My hands feel around on the mangled\\r\\nbody. I feel the shattered limbs come apart under the clothes. I pull\\r\\nMorin out from underneath by his arms. He remains motionless for a\\r\\nmoment. He is stupid from the shock and fright. I shake him. The arrival\\r\\nof a new engine of death which explodes beside us brings him back to\\r\\nreality and the imminence of danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time we run as fast as we can, stumbling over the débris, tripping\\r\\nover the dead, rolling into shell holes, tearing our clothes, hands, and\\r\\nfaces on the barbed wire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe flee, absolutely breathless, across old trenches which we see only\\r\\nwhen their depths yawn before our steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe flee haggard, in a mad delirium, terrified, pursued by the vision of\\r\\nour dead, of their dim faces, their torn brows, their glassy eyes, their\\r\\ntwisted mouths, which the shells still mangle ... which the enemy kill\\r\\nagain in their sleep of death.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe flee encircled by the rattle of the fire which pursues us, and which\\r\\nwith us draws near the road which we wish to reach and it to bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nA more violent puff, and close by, grazes our heads.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Attention!... Stop.... To earth!”\\r\\n\\r\\nA violent shock, a heavy blow between the shoulders, a hard vice grips my\\r\\nbody and throws me on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fall, and then I remember nothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\nDISCHARGED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, _mon vieux_, swallow this; it will set you up.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA sergeant of the 88th Territorials is speaking. I see his white number\\r\\nas he bends over me. I swallow the contents of the cup at one draught.\\r\\nOuf! it’s strong; it burns, but I feel my strength coming back.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere am I?\\r\\n\\r\\nI am behind a bank in a dugout cut in the side of the trench. How I got\\r\\nthere I don’t know. I have lost all idea of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am anxious about Morin. They don’t know, but they say that they saw\\r\\nstretcher-bearers pick him up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have received my reckoning, but I shall recover. I feel my trousers and\\r\\nboots heavy with a tepid dampness. I feel a shooting pain in the groin\\r\\nand something like a warm stream flows drop by drop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stretcher-bearer, Bertrand, an old college friend, now a Dominican,\\r\\nstops a second beside me, hurrying on to more pressing cares, to the more\\r\\nseriously wounded. He speaks kindly simple words, but what they are I\\r\\nknow not. He speaks of country, the sun, my wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wife, the sun, the country, the return to life, the walks as of old in\\r\\nthe woods, in the hills, the dreams at twilight, the cherished plans, the\\r\\ntalk of love. Life is beginning again. Yes, we will begin all that again.\\r\\nAnd it will be finer now ... after the test.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great relaxation comes; tears flow. I hardly suffer, but I am weak. I\\r\\nwant to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stretcher-bearers will come presently, as I know, at nightfall. And\\r\\nthrough the roof of boughs I see the sun die away and the stars come out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bombardment rolls in distant thunder; they say that it is increasing,\\r\\ncoming nearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes that mean a counter attack?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sinister heavy blow of a great Boche shell shakes the earth of my\\r\\ndugout, and the leaves of my roof fall in torrents on my covering.\\r\\n\\r\\nI already feel anxious to get away. I am afraid now. I dread the final\\r\\nwound which will tear me, shatter me, kill me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is dark night. Great drops begin to fall. It is going to rain very\\r\\nhard. The stretcher-bearers have come. I have to move so that they can\\r\\nplace me on the stretcher. I feel the warm stream gush out; it is very\\r\\nstrong this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I fainted.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the casualty clearing station at Villers an old major with a white\\r\\nbeard gives me an injection of antitetanic serum.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother examines my gaping wound.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Iodine dressing, H. O. E.[2] Discharge to private life.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd an automobile takes me speedily to the station where the sanitary\\r\\ntrain waits with steam up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sanitary train!... For two days each roll of the wheels sounds in my\\r\\nhead like a great bell; and the belt which binds me seems tightened into\\r\\nthe most atrocious notch; at each turn of the wheels, at every movement\\r\\nit seems to me that the stream will begin to flow again, and that this\\r\\ntime it will all flow out until it is exhausted ... with my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, one evening, the rolling ceased; my stretcher was unhooked and they\\r\\ngave me something to drink.... I woke up in the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nA white bed, lights, nurses in white, who speak, who smile, who glide\\r\\nover the floors without making a noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan it be true? I no longer hear the noise, the hammering of cannon, and\\r\\nthe infernal rolling of autos and caissons. It is strange.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take No. 7 to the operating room,” says the head doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am No. 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe operating room.... It is all bright and white; through haggard eyes I\\r\\nlook at the shining knives, the reflection of the glass, but a sharp odor\\r\\nseizes me, sickens me, stifles me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am stifling.... My breath stops in my chest and no longer reaches\\r\\nmy throat.... I am stifling.... No, I hear the bells.... I hear the\\r\\nbells.... How good they sound!\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it a dream?\\r\\n\\r\\nAn anxious face, shining eyes, lips trembling with a kiss, the beautiful\\r\\nloved hair with its familiar perfume.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the gentle caress on my forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth arms close about it feverishly, as if never to let it go, on this\\r\\ndear being who brings with her kiss: love, life, the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! you! you! at last! forever!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Georges, yes, forever. I am here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the nurse standing at the foot of the little brass bed smiles with\\r\\ntears in her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] Commandant’s Post.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] Hospital for the Discharged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Covered With Mud and Glory, by Georges Lafond\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK COVERED WITH MUD AND GLORY ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 60268-0.txt or 60268-0.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/0/2/6/60268/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by ellinora and the Online Distributed Proofreading\\r\\nTeam at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from\\r\\nimages generously made available by The Internet\\r\\nArchive/American Libraries.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\r\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\r\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\r\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\r\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\r\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\r\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
